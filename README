HOW TO BUILD A FIRMWARE FOR THE ACTIONTEC MI424WR Rev-I Router
--------------------------------------------------------------

* How to install the MI424WR Rev-I source code onto the Linux workstation
* How to build the firmware that can be loaded on to a Actiontec 
  MI424WR Rev-I board
* How to upgrade the MI424WR Rev-I with the new firmware image file.

NOTE: The following procedures are known to work with recent versions of 
Fedora, like versions 10, 11 or 12. Along with the Basic Fedora Install you 
will want to add the Software Developement packages that are provided with 
Fedora. 

Warning!! These instructions do not build a fully functional modem/router. You
will need to add a way to access the device into the code, before compiling it.
(i.e. SSH, Telnet, or some type of GUI)

The Actiontec MI424WR Rev-I Source Code, i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler, 
arm-none-linux-gnueabi toolchain and jpkg package can be obtained from 
the Actiontec support website at http://opensource.actiontec.com.

1. Download source code, i386 GNU compiler, ARM toolchain and JPKG package
   (4 files)
   Source code: actiontec_opensrc_mi424wr-rev-i_fw-40-21-10-2.tar.gz
   i386 GNU compiler: i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ARM Toochain: toolchain-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.jpkg
   JPKG package: jpkg.tar.gz
 
2. Copy or Move the source code to the HOME directory
   $ cp actiontec_opensrc_mi424wr-rev-i_fw-40-21-10-2.tar.gz $HOME

3. Change to the Home directory
   $ cd $HOME

4. Extract the contents of the source code
   $ tar -zxvf actiontec_opensrc_mi424wr-rev-i_fw-40-21-10-2.tar.gz

   IMPORTANT: Extracting the source code creates the directory 
   "opensource-mi424wr-rev-i" and the subdirectory "rg". The bulk 
   of the source code resides in "rg". The Makefiles in the distribution 
   expects that Jungo's openrg GCC 3.3.2 based compiler will be located 
   at "/usr/local/openrg". Both the x86 (i386-jungo-linux-gnu) and 
   ARM (arm-none-linux-gnueabi) compilers should be installed to the 
   "openrg" directory.

5. The following commands assume that the User is still in the Home directory.

6. Change to Super User for the following commands, requires the root password
   $ su - 
   PASSWORD:

7. Create the "openrg" directory at "/usr/local"
  # mkdir /usr/local/openrg

8. Move the compiler, toolchain and jpkg package to the "openrg" directory
  # mv i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
  # mv jpkg.tar.gz /usr/local/openrg
  # mv toolchain-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.jpkg /usr/local/openrg

9. Change to the "openrg" directory
  # cd /usr/local/openrg

10. Extract the contents of the i386-jungo-linux-gnu compiler
  # tar -zxvf i386-jungo-linux-gnu.tar.gz 

11. Extract the contents of the jpkg package
  # tar -zxvf jpkg.tar.gz

12. Install and prepare the toolchain
  # ./jpkg -x -C / toolchain-arm-none-linux-gnueabi.jpkg

13. Change to the original Home directory, the place-holder called <account>, 
  represents the name of the account you were using before you changed to Super 
  User, earlier in these directions. If your login is "bobby", then there will 
  be a directory within the Home directory named "bobby", and that is where you 
  will find the "/opensource-mi424wr-rev-i/rg" directory. If so, the command 
  would look like this: "cd /home/bobby/opensource-mi424wr-rev-i/rg".)
  # cd /home/<account>/opensource-mi424wr-rev-i/rg

14. When you have changed to the "rg" directory, the following command will 
    build the new image.
  # make config DIST=FEROCEON CONFIG_RG_GPL=y LIC=../jpkg_actiontec_gpl.lic && make


-------------------------------------
HOW TO UPLOAD THE IMAGE TO THE ROUTER
-------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: In order to load the firmware onto the router, the user will need 
a serial debug board and a TFTP server.

1. Set up the TFTP server, copy the newly created "MI424WR-GEN3I.img" file 
   from the build to TFTP server folder as "openrg.img". The "MI424WR-GEN3I.img" 
   is generated under /home/<account>/opensource-mi424wr-rev-i/rg/build/os/ 
   directory.
  # cp /home/<account>/opensource-mi424wr-rev-i/rg/build/os/MI424WR-GEN3I.img /tftpboot/openrg.img

2. Boot up the Router with serial debug connected to PC. 

3. Press Enter continuously to enter bootloader prompt.

4. Set environment variables (if they're not set) to load from tftp:
   set serverip <TFTP server IP>
   set ipaddr <IP address>

5. Load the firmware using TFTP dn boot the system:
   run openrg_net
