The following is a list of files and features that are going to be
removed in the mtd-utils source tree.  Every entry should contain what
exactly is going away, why it is happening, and who is going to be doing
the work.  When the feature is removed from the utils, it should also
be removed from this file.

---------------------------
1. Kill --squash-rino-perm and --nosquash-rino-perm parameters of mkfs.ubifs.

Originally, mkfs.ubifs did not have these parameters, and it always set
permissions for the UBIFS root inode to be {uid=gid=root, u+rwx,go+rx}. This was
a bug which was found too late, when mkfs.ubifs had already been used in
production. To fix this bug, 2 new options were introduced:
--squash-rino-perm which preserves the old behavior and --nosquash-rino-perm
which makes mkfs.ubifs use the right permissions for the root
inode.

For a while (releases 1.4.0-1.4.3) --squash-rino-perm was the default, and if
neither --squash-rino-perm nor --nosquash-rino-perm were used,
mkfs.ubifs printed a warning. This was introduced in mtd-utils-1.4.0 (13 Sep 2010).

Now we have removed a warning and made --nosquash-rino-perm to be the
default. Also, both options are declared depricated, so users should try
to stop using them.

The further step is to remove both of them.
