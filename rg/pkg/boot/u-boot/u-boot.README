How to recreate u-boot.bin
==========================

u-boot is a free-software (GPL) boot-loader.

Source to compile u-boot.bin can be fetched from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/u-boot.
Connect to u-boot cvs repository and check out the source code of
28-Nov-2005 (later versions may also be good, but were not tested).
After fetching sources, you need to apply the u-boot.patch file 
(in this directory).

Note that patch changes may have already been merged into later versions 
of u-boot.
