ServPoET
--------

ServPoET is a commercial version of the PPPoE server.  While everything
you received in this package is licensed under the GNU General Public
License, ServPoET is not free software and is licensed under a traditional
commercial license.

ServPoET features RADIUS support, support for different realms,
real-time server status reporting and a friendly curses-based GUI for
administration.  For information on ServPoET:

While ServPoET is licensed as traditional closed-source software, we still
strongly support free software.  To illustrate that support, we are committed
to:

- Porting all core server and client improvements from ServPoET to the
GPL'd rp-pppoe immediately.  For example, Release 3.1 of rp-pppoe
incorporates many improvements to the server which were done as part
of the ServPoET work.

- Donating 5% of all our ServPoET revenues to the Free Software Foundation.

- Two years after introducing a ServPoET feature, releasing that feature
under the GPL.  This is similar to the approach Alladin took with Ghostscript.

We need to balance the creation of GPL'd software against the need to
generate revenue to support software development, and we believe
this model is the best option for Roaring Penguin Software and the
free software community.
