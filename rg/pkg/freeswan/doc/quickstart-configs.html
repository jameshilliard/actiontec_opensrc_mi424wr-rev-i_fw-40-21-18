<P>These are sample<A href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html"> ipsec.conf(5)</A>
 configuration files for opportunistic encryption, with comments. Much
 of this configuration will be unnecessary with the new defaults
 proposed for FreeS/WAN 2.x.</P>
<H2><A name="qc.opp.client">config for initiate-only opportunistic
 encryption</A></H2>
<P>Full instructions for this setup are in our<A href="quickstart.html#opp.client">
 quickstart guide</A>.</P>
<P>The ipsec.conf file for an initiate-only opportunistic setup is:</P>
<PRE># general IPsec setup
config setup
        # Use the default interface
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        # Use auto= parameters in conn descriptions to control startup actions.
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search

# defaults for subsequent connection descriptions
conn %default
        # How to authenticate gateways
        authby=rsasig
        # default is
        # load connection description into Pluto's database
        # so it can respond if another gatway initiates
        # individual connection descriptions may override this
        auto=add

# description for opportunistic connections
conn me-to-anyone
        left=%defaultroute         # all connections should use default route
        right=%opportunistic       # anyone we can authenticate
        rightrsasigkey=%dns        # look up their key in DNS
        auto=route                 # set up for opportunistic
        rekey=no                   # let unused connections die
        leftid=@xy.example.com     # our identity for IPSec negotiations
                                   # must match DNS and ipsec.secrets</PRE>
<P>Normally, the last line above is the only one that you need to edit.
 However, some people may need to customize the<VAR> interfaces=</VAR>
 line in the &quot;config setup&quot; section. All other sections are identical
 for any standalone machine doing opportunistic encryption.</P>
<P>The @ sign in the<VAR> leftid=</VAR> makes the ID go &quot;over the wire&quot;
 as a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). Without it, an IP address
 would be used and this won't work.</P>
<P>The conn is not used to supply either public key. Your private key is
 in<A href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html"> ipsec.secrets(5)</A> and,
 for opportunistic encryption, the public keys for remote gateways are
 all looked up in DNS.</P>
<P>FreeS/WAN authenticates opportunistic encryption by<A href="#gen_rsa">
 RSA signature</A> only, so &quot;public key&quot; and &quot;private key&quot; refer to
 these keys.</P>
<P>While the<VAR> left</VAR> and<VAR> right</VAR> designations here are
 arbitrary, we follow a convention of using<VAR> left</VAR> for local
 and<VAR> right</VAR> for remote.</P>

 initiate-only opportunism.</A></P>
<H2><A name="qc.incoming.opp.conf">ipsec.conf for incoming opportunistic
 encryption</A></H2>
 Use the ipsec.conf above, except that the section describing
 opportunistic connections is now:
<PRE>
# description for opportunistic connections
conn me-to-anyone
        left=%defaultroute         # all connections should use default route
        right=%opportunistic       # anyone we can authenticate
        rightrsasigkey=%dns        # look up their key in DNS
        auto=route                 # set up for opportunistic
        rekey=no                   # let unused connections die</PRE>
<P>Note that<VAR> leftid=</VAR> has been removed.</P>

 opportunism.</A></P>
<H2><A name="qc.rw.client">ipsec.conf for road warrior client</A></H2>
<P>Here is our new connection, with comments:</P>
<PRE>conn us-to-office
        #
        # information obtained from office system admin
        # goes to the right of the = signs in these lines
        # values shown here are just for example
        #
        left=1.2.3.4                # gateway IP address
        leftsubnet=42.42.42.0/24   # the office network
        leftid=@gateway.example.com
        # real keys are much longer than shown here
        leftrsasigkey=0s1LgR7/oUM...
        #
        # our stuff
        #
        # all connections should use our default route
        # also controls the source address on IPsec packets
        right=%defaultroute
        # our identity for IPsec negotiations
        rightid=@xy.example.com</PRE>
<P>Everything else remains as it was when we had only opportunistic
 connections.</P>
<P><A href="quickstart.html#rw.client">Return to our quickstart
 document.</A></P>
<H2><A name="qc.modular.rw.client">A modular ipsec.conf</A></H2>
<P>Once you have more than one connection, you may want to design your
 ipsec.conf in a modular fashion. This will help you avoid retyping
 information. Use<VAR> also=</VAR> to include one full or partial
 connection description within another.</P>
<P>Here is a sample modular ipsec.conf file for our situation. Since the<VAR>
 right...</VAR> information is common to both our connections, we place
 it in the partial connection our_stuff, which looks like:</P>
<PRE>conn our_stuff
        # all connections should use our default route
        # also controls the source address on IPsec packets
        right=%defaultroute
        # our identity for IPsec negotiations
        # must match what is in DNS and ipsec.secrets(5)
        rightid=@xy.example.com</PRE>
<P>We then include this information in other conns with the line:</P>
<PRE>	also=our_stuff</PRE>
<P>For this to work,<VAR> conn our_stuff</VAR> must come last.</P>
<P>The resulting modular ipsec.conf looks like:</P>
<PRE># general IPsec setup
config setup
        # Use the default interface
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        # Use auto= parameters in conn descriptions to control startup actions.
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search

# description for opportunistic connections
conn me-to-anyone
        also=our_stuff             # our system details, stored below
        left=%opportunistic        # anyone we can authenticate
        leftrsasigkey=%dns         # look up their key in DNS
        auto=route                 # set up for opportunistic
        rekey=no                   # let unused connections die

# pre-configured link to office network
# added for this example
conn us-to-office
        also=our_stuff             # our system details, stored below
        #
        # information obtained from office system admin
        # goes to the right of the = signs in these lines
        # values shown here are just for example
        #
        left=1.2.3.4                # gateway IP address
        leftsubnet=42.42.42.0/24   # the office network
        leftid=@gateway.example.com
        # real keys are much longer than shown here
        leftrsasigkey=0s1LgR7/oUM...

# description of our system
# included in other connection descriptions via also= lines
# must come after the lines that use it
conn our_stuff
        # all connections should use our default route
        # also controls the source address on IPsec packets
        right=%defaultroute
        # our identity for IPsec negotiations
        # must match what is in DNS and ipsec.secrets(5)
        rightid=@xy.example.com</PRE>
<P>Note that you cannot put an<VAR> auto=start</VAR> line into an
 included connection like<VAR> our_stuff</VAR>.</P>
<P>Of course, if need be, you can mix modular and nonmodular elements in
 any ipsec.conf.</P>
