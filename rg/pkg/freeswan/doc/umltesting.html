<P> User mode linux is a way to compile a linux kernel such that it can
 run as a process in another linux system (potentially as a *BSD or
 Windows process later). See<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">
 http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/</A></P>
<P> UML is a good platform for testing and experimenting with FreeS/WAN.
 It allows several network nodes to be simulated on a single machine.
 Creating, configuring, installing, monitoring, and controling these
 nodes is generally easier and easier to script with UML than real
 hardware.</P>
<P> You'll need about 500Mb of disk space for a full
 sunrise-east-west-sunset setup. You can possibly get this down by 130Mb
 if you remove the sunrise/sunset kernel build. If you just want to run,
 then you can even remove the east/west kernel build.</P>
<P> Nothing need be done as super user. In a couple of steps, we note
 where super user is required to install commands in system-wide
 directories, but ~/bin could be used instead. UML seems to use a
 system-wide /tmp/uml directory so different users may interfere with
 one another.</P>

 umlfreeroot-6.0.tar.gz (or highest numbered one). This is a debian
 potato root file system. You can use this even on a Redhat host, as it
 has the newer GLIBC2.2 libraries as well.
<!-- If you are using
  Redhat 7.2 or newer as your development machine, you can create the
  image from your installation media. See <A HREF="uml-rhroot.html">Building a RedHat root"></A>.
  A future document will explain how to build this from .DEB files as well.

<LI> umlfreesharemini.tar.gz    (or umlfreeshareall.tar.gz).

<LI> From<A HREF="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/">
 ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/</A> a snapshot or release
 (1.92 or better)</LI>
<LI> From<A HREF="http://linux.kernel.org/mirrors.html">
 http://linux.kernel.org mirror</A>, the virgin 2.4.17 kernel. (if you
 get a future kernel, then please report success/failure. AC kernels
 already have UML patched, so the patch is unnecessary. Below, set
 UMLPATCH to /dev/null.)</LI>
<LI>
<!-- Note: this step is refered to as "step 1d" below. -->
 Get<A HREF="http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/">
 http://ftp.nl.linux.org/uml/</A> uml-patch-2.4.17-10.bz2 or the one
 associated with your kernel. If you use an AC kernel, you don't need
 this patch. More recent versions of the patch have not been tested by
 us.</LI>
<LI> You'll probably want to visit<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net">
 http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net</A> and get the UML utilities.
 These are not needed for the build or interactive use (but
 recommended). They are necessary for the regression testing procedures
 used by &quot;make check&quot;. We currently use uml_utilities_20020212.tar.bz2.</LI>
<LI> You need tcpdump version 3.7.1 or better. This is newer than the
 version included in most LINUX distributions. You can check the version
 of an installed tcpdump with the --version flag. If you need a newer
 tcpdump fetch both tcpdump and libpcap source tar files from<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">
 http://www.tcpdump.org/</A> or a mirror.</LI>

 2.4.17 kernel. For instance:
<PRE>
 <CODE>           mkdir -p /c2/kernel/linux-2.4.17
           cd /c2/kernel/linux-2.4.17
           tar xzvf ../download/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.17.tar.gz
</CODE>
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> extract the umlfreeroot file
<!-- (unless you <A HREF="uml-rhroot.html">built your own from RPMs</A>) -->

<PRE>
 <CODE>           mkdir -p /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           cd /c2/user-mode-linux/basic-root
           tar xzvf ../download/umlfreeroot-6.0.tar.gz
</CODE>
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> FreeSWAN itself (or checkout &quot;all&quot; from CVS)
<PRE>
 <CODE>           mkdir -p /c2/freeswan/sandbox
           cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox
           tar xzvf ../download/snapshot.tar.gz
</CODE>
</PRE>

</OL>
</LI>
<LI> If you need to build a newer tcpdump:
<UL>
<LI> Make sure you have OpenSSL installed -- it is needed for
 cryptographic routines.</LI>
<LI> Unpack libpcap and tcpdump source in parallel directories (the
 tcpdump build procedures look for libpcap next door).</LI>
<LI> Change directory into the libpcap source directory and then build
 the library:
<PRE>
 <CODE>	./configure
	make
</CODE>
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> Change into the tcpdump source directory, build tcpdump, and
 install it.
<PRE>
 <CODE>	./configure
	make
	# Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
	# Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
	su -c &quot;make install&quot;
</CODE>
</PRE>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI> If you need the uml utilities, unpack them somewhere then build and
 install them:
<PRE>
 <CODE>	cd tools
	make all
	# Need to be superuser to install in system directories.
	# Installing in ~/bin would be an alternative.
	su -c &quot;make install BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin&quot;
</CODE>
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI> set up the configuration file
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>cd /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97/testing/utils</CODE></LI>
<LI> copy umlsetup-sample.sh to ../../umlsetup.sh: <CODE> cp
 umlsetup-sample.sh ../../umlsetup.sh</CODE></LI>
<LI> open up ../../umlsetup.sh in your favorite editor.</LI>
<LI> change POOLSPACE= to point to the place with at least 500Mb of
 disk. Best if it is on the same partition as the &quot;umlfreeroot&quot;
 extraction, as it will attempt to use hard links if possible to save
 disk space.</LI>
<LI> Set TESTINGROOT if you intend to run the script outside of the
 sandbox/snapshot/release directory. Otherwise, it will configure
 itself.</LI>
<LI> KERNPOOL should point to the directory with your 2.4.17 kernel
 tree. This tree should be unconfigured! This is the directory you used
 in step 2a.</LI>
<LI> UMLPATCH should point at the bz2 file you downloaded at 1d. If
 using a kernel that already includes the patch, set this to /dev/null.</LI>
<LI> FREESWANDIR should point at the directory where you unpacked the
 snapshot/release. Include the &quot;freeswan-snap2001sep16b&quot; or whatever in
 it. If you are running from CVS, then you point at the directory where
 top, klips, etc. are. The script will fix up the directory so that it
 can be used.</LI>
<LI> BASICROOT should be set to the directory used in 2b, or to the
 directory that you created with RPMs.</LI>
<LI> SHAREDIR should be set to the directory used in 2c, to /usr/share
 for Debian potato users, or to $BASICROOT/usr/share.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
<PRE> <CODE>cd $TESTINGROOT/utils
sh make-uml.sh
</CODE></PRE>
 It will grind for awhile. If there are errors it will bail. If so, run
 it under &quot;script&quot; and send the output to bugs@lists.freeswan.org.</LI>
<LI> You will have a bunch of stuff under $POOLSPACE. Open four xterms:
<PRE> <CODE>    for i in sunrise sunset east west
    do
        xterm -name $i -title $i -e $POOLSPACE/$i/start.sh     done
</CODE></PRE>
</LI>
<LI> Login as root. Password is &quot;root&quot; (Note, these virtual machines are
 networked together, but are not configured to talk to the rest of the
 world.)</LI>
<LI> verify that pluto started on east/west, run &quot;ipsec look&quot;</LI>
<LI> login to sunrise. run &quot;ping sunset&quot;</LI>
<LI> login to west. run &quot;tcpdump -p -i eth1 -n&quot; (tcpdump must be version
 3.7.1 or newer)</LI>
<LI> Closing a console xterm will shut down that UML.</LI>
<LI> You can &quot;make check&quot;, if you want to. It is run from
 /c2/freeswan/sandbox/freeswan-1.97.</LI>
