<H1><A name="makecheck">How to configure to use &quot;make check&quot;</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="28_1">What is &quot;make check&quot;</A></H2>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; is a target in the top level makefile. It takes care of
 running a number of unit and system tests to confirm that FreeSWAN has
 been compiled correctly, and that no new bugs have been introduced.</P>
<P> As FreeSWAN contains both kernel and userspace components, doing
 testing of FreeSWAN requires that the kernel be simulated. This is
 typically difficult to do as a kernel requires that it be run on bare
 hardware. A technology has emerged that makes this simpler. This is<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net">
 User Mode Linux</A>.</P>
<P> User-Mode Linux is a way to build a Linux kernel such that it can
 run as a process under another Linux (or in the future other) kernel.
 Presently, this can only be done for 2.4 guest kernels. The host kernel
 can be 2.2 or 2.4.</P>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; expects to be able to build User-Mode Linux kernels
 with FreeSWAN included. To do this it needs to have some files
 downloaded and extracted prior to running &quot;make check&quot;. This is
 described in the<A HREF="umltesting.html"> UML testing</A> document.</P>
<P> After having run the example in the UML testing document and
 successfully brought up the four machine combination, you are ready to
 use &quot;make check&quot;</P>
<H2><A NAME="28_2">Running &quot;make check&quot;</A></H2>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; works by walking the FreeSWAN source tree invoking the
 &quot;check&quot; target at each node. At present there are tests defined only
 for the <CODE>klips</CODE> directory. These tests will use the UML
 infrastructure to test out pieces of the <CODE>klips</CODE> code.</P>
<P> The results of the tests can be recorded. If the environment
 variable <CODE>$REGRESSRESULTS</CODE> is non-null, then the results of
 each test will be recorded. This can be used as part of a nightly
 regression testing system, see<A HREF="nightly.html"> Nightly testing</A>
 for more details.</P>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; otherwise prints a minimal amount of output for each
 test, and indicates pass/fail status of each test as they are run.
 Failed tests do not cause failure of the target in the form of exit
 codes.</P>
<H1><A NAME="29">How to write a KLIPS &quot;make check&quot; test</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="29_1">Structure of a test</A></H2>
<P> Each test consists of a directory in <CODE>klips/test</CODE>. The
 list of tests to run is stored in the file <CODE>klips/test/TESTLIST</CODE>
. The test types are:</P>
<DL>
<DT>skiptest</DT>
<DD>means run no test.</DD>
<DT>ctltest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a single system without input/output.</DD>
<DT>klipstest</DT>
<DD>means run a single system with input/output networks</DD>
<DT>plutotest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a pair of systems</DD>
<DT>suntest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a quad of east/west/sunrise/sunset</DD>
<DT>roadtest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a trio of east-sunrise + warrior</DD>
<DT>extrudedtest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a quad of east-sunrise + warriorsouth + park</DD>
</DL>
 At present only <CODE>klipstest</CODE> has been defined.
<P> Each test directory has a file in it called <CODE>testparams.sh</CODE>
. This file sets a number of environment variables to define the
 parameters of the test.</P>
<H2><A NAME="29_2">Common parameters</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT>TESTNAME</DT>
<DD>the name of the test (repeated for checking purposes)</DD>
<DT>TESTHOST</DT>
<DD>the name of the UML machine to run for the test, typically &quot;east&quot; or
 &quot;west&quot;</DD>
<DT>TEST_PURPOSE</DT>
<DD>The purpose of the test is one of:
<DL>
<DT>goal</DT>
<DD>The goal purpose is where a test is defined for code that is not yet
 finished. The test indicates when the goals have in fact been reached.</DD>
<DT>regress</DT>
<DD>This is a test to determine that a previously existing bug has been
 repaired. This test will initially be created to reproduce the bug in
 isolation, and then the bug will be fixed.</DD>
<DT>exploit</DT>
<DD>This is a set of packets/programs that causes a vulnerability to be
 exposed. It is a specific variation of the regress option.</DD>
</DL>
</DD>
<DT>TEST_GOAL_ITEM</DT>
<DT></DT>
<DD>in the case of a goal test, this is a reference to the requirements
 document</DD>
<DT>TEST_PROB_REPORT</DT>
<DD>in the case of regression test, this the problem report number from
 GNATS</DD>
<DT>TEST_EXPLOIT_URL</DT>
<DD>in the case of an exploit, this is a URL referencing the paper
 explaining the origin of the test and the origin of exploit software</DD>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a file in the test directory that contains the sanitized console
 output against which to compare the output of the actual test.</DD>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS</DT>
<DD>a list of scripts (found in <CODE>klips/test/fixups</CODE>) to apply
 to sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These are
 typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in the kernel
 output that change each time the test is run and/or compiled.</DD>
<DT>SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode prior to starting the tests. This file will usually
 set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are required for the test.</P>
<P>Lines beginning with # are skipped. Blank lines are skipped.
 Otherwise, a shell prompted is waited for each time (consisting of <CODE>
\n#</CODE>) and then the command is sent. Note that the prompt is waited
 for before the command and not after, so completion of the last command
 in the script is not required. This is often used to invoke a program
 to monitor the system, e.g. <CODE>ipsec pf_key</CODE>.</P>
</DD>
<H2><A NAME="29_3">KLIPStest paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The klipstest function starts a program (<CODE>
testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig</CODE>) to setup a bunch of I/O
 sockets (that simulate network interfaces). It then exports the
 references to these sockets to the environment and invokes (using
 system()) a given script. It waits for the script to finish.</P>
<P> The script invoked (<CODE>testing/utils/host-test.tcl</CODE>) is a
 TCL<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov/"> expect</A> script that arranges
 to start the UML and configure it appropriately for the test. The
 configuration is done with the script given above for<VAR> SCRIPT</VAR>
. The TCL script then forks, leaves the UML in the background and exits.
 uml_netjig continues. It then starts listening to the simulated network
 answering ARPs and inserting packets as appropriate.</P>
<P> The klipstest function invokes <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> with
 arguments to capture output from network interface(s) and insert
 packets as appropriate:</P>
<DT></DT>
<DT>PUBINPUT</DT>
<DD>a<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/"> pcap</A> file to feed in on the
 public (encrypted) interface. (typically, eth1)</DD>
<DT>PRIVINPUT</DT>
<DD>a pcap file to feed in on the private (plain-text) interface
 (typically, eth0).</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the public (eth1)
 interface are captured to a<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/"> pcap</A>
 file by <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. The klipstest function then uses
 tcpdump on the file to produce text output, which is compared to the
 file given.</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
 processing. Defaults to &quot;cat&quot;.</DD>
<DT>REF_PRIV_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private (eth0)
 interface are captured and compared after conversion by tcpdump, as
 with<VAR> REFPUBOUTPUT</VAR>.</DD>
<DT>REF_PRIV_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
 processing. Defaults to &quot;cat&quot;.</DD>
&lt; DT&gt;EXITONEMPTY
<DD>a flag for <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. It should contain
 &quot;--exitonempty&quot; of uml_netjig should exit when all of the input (<VAR>
PUBINPUT</VAR>,<VAR>PRIVINPUT</VAR>) packets have been injected.</DD>
<DT>ARPREPLY</DT>
<DD>a flag for <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. It should contain &quot;--arpreply&quot;
 if <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> should reply to ARP requests. One will
 typically set this to avoid having to fudge the ARP cache manually.</DD>
<DT>TCPDUMPFLAGS</DT>
<DD>a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured output.
 Typical values will include &quot;-n&quot; to turn off DNS, and often &quot;-E&quot; to set
 the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher only) for ESP packets. The
 &quot;-t&quot; flag (turn off timestamps) is provided automatically</DD>
<H2><A NAME="29_4">Invoking tests manually</A></H2>
<P> If you need to interactively control the UML under test, then you
 can invoke netjig directly with the right arguments, but give it &quot;sh&quot;
 as the startup script. An easy way is to do this is to edit
 &quot;NETJIGDEBUG&quot; in setup.sh to &quot;true&quot; and run the test:</P>
<P> e.g:</P>
<PRE>
cassidy-[nightly/klips/test/east-pass-01] mcr 1009 %NETJIGDEBUG=true ../runme.sh
/c2/freeswan/sandboxes/nightly/testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig --tcpdump --exitonempty --playprivate ../inputs/01-sunrise-sunset-ping.pcap --recordpublic OUTPUT/spi1-output.pcap --startup expect -f /c2/freeswan/sandboxes/nightly/testing/utils/host-test.tcl /c2/freeswan/sandboxes/nightly/UMLPOOL/east/start.sh spi1.sh 
</PRE>
 so, substitute &quot;sh&quot; for the startup script.
<PRE>
/c2/freeswan/sandboxes/nightly/testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig --tcpdump --exitonempty --playprivate ../inputs/01-sunrise-sunset-ping.pcap --recordpublic OUTPUT/spi1-output.pcap --startup sh

sh-2.05a$ env | grep UML_
UML_private_CTL=/tmp/umlz8Xrpn/private/ctl
UML_public_DATA=/tmp/umlz8Xrpn/public/data
UML_public_CTL=/tmp/umlz8Xrpn/public/ctl
UML_private_DATA=/tmp/umlz8Xrpn/private/data
</PRE>
<P> then, in a *new window*, paste those variables in place, and start
 the UML you need. The start.sh scripts looks for
 UML_{private,public}_{CTL,DATA} and will connect them to eth0/eth1.
 Setup the UML as appropriate, etc. When you are ready, exit the above
 shell, and the uml_netjig will start to inject packets and record them.</P>
<H1><A NAME="30">Current pitfalls</A></H1>
<DL>
<DT> &quot;tcpdump dissector&quot; not available.</DT>
<DD> This is a non-fatal warning. If uml_netjig is invoked with the -t
 option, then it will attempt to use tcpdump's dissector to decode each
 packet that it processes. The dissector is presently not available, so
 this option it normally turned off at compile time. The dissector
 library will be released with tcpdump version 4.0.</DD>
