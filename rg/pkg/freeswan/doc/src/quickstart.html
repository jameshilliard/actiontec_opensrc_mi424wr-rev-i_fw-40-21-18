<H2><A name="opp.setup">Purpose</A></H2>

<P>This page will get you started using Linux FreeS/WAN with opportunistic
 encryption (OE). OE enables you to set up IPsec tunnels
 to a site without co-ordinating with the site administrator,
 and without hand configuring each tunnel.
 If enough sites support OE, a &quot;FAX effect&quot; occurs, and
 many of us can communicate without eavesdroppers.</P>

<P>Opportunistic encryption is new technology and we are still working
out some fine points. Please see 
<A HREF="opportunism.known-issues">this list</A> of known issues.
</P>


<H2><A name="opp.dns">Requirements</A></H2>

<P>To set up opportunistic encryption, you will need:</P>
<UL>
<LI>to be running Linux</LI>
<LI>to install Linux FreeS/WAN 1.98b or better</LI>
<LI>either control over your reverse DNS (for full opportunism) or 
the ability to write to some forward domain (for initiator-only)</LI>
<LI>(for full opportunism) a static IP</LI>
</UL>

<P>Note: Only Linux FreeS/WAN supports opportunistic encryption.</P>

<H2><A name="easy.install">RPM installation</A></H2>

<P>Our instructions are for a recent Red Hat with a stock Red Hat kernel.
For other ways to install, see our 
<A href="install.html#install">install document</A>.</P>

<H3>Download RPMs</H3>

<P>Check your kernel version with</P>
<PRE>   uname -a</PRE>

<P>From our
<A href="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/RedHat-RPMs">FTP site</A>, 
get the kernel module which matches your kernel. For example:</P>
<PRE>    freeswan-module-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm</PRE>
<P>Note: Our kernel modules 
<B>will only work on the Red Hat kernel they were built for</B>,
since they are very sensitive to small changes in the kernel.</P>

<P>Get FreeS/WAN utilities to match. For example:</P>
<PRE>    freeswan-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm</PRE>



<H3>Check signatures</H3>

<P>While you're at our ftp site, grab the RPM signing key</P>
<PRE>    freeswan-rpmsign.asc</PRE>

<P>If you're running RedHat 8.x, import this key into the RPM database:</P>
<PRE>    rpm --import freeswan-rpmsign.asc</PRE>

<P>For RedHat 7.x systems, you'll need to add it to your PGP keyring:</P>
<PRE>    pgp -ka freeswan-rpmsign.asc</PRE>

<P>Check the signatures on both RPMs using:</P>
<PRE>    rpm --checksig freeswan-module-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm
    rpm --checksig freeswan-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm</PRE>

<P>You should see:</P>
<PRE>    freeswan-module-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm: pgp md5 OK
    freeswan-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm: pgp md5 OK</PRE>


<H3>Install the RPMs</H3>

<P>Become root:</P>
<PRE>    su</PRE>

<P>Install your RPMs with:<P>
<PRE>    rpm -ivh freeswan-module-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm</PRE>
<PRE>    rpm -ivh freeswan-1.99_2.4.18_3-0.i386.rpm</PRE>

<P>Then, start FreeS/WAN:</P>
<PRE>    service ipsec start</PRE>



<H3><A name="testinstall">Test</A></H3>
<P>To check that you have a successful install, run:</P>
<PRE>    ipsec verify</PRE>

<P>You should see at least:</P>
<PRE>
    Checking your system to see if IPsec got installed and started correctly
    Version check and ipsec on-path                             [OK]
    Checking for KLIPS support in kernel                        [OK]
    Checking for RSA private key (/etc/ipsec.secrets)           [OK]
    Checking that pluto is running                              [OK]
</PRE>

<P>If any of these first four checks fails, see our 
<A href="trouble.html#install.check">troubleshooting guide</A>.
</P>

<H2><A name="opp.setups.list">Our Opportunistic Setups</A></H2>
<H3>Full or partial opportunism?</H3>
<P>Determine the fullest form of opportunism your system can support.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For <A HREF="#opp.incoming">full opportunism</A>, you'll need a static
IP and and either control over your reverse DNS or an ISP
that can add the required TXT + KEY Records for you.</LI>
<LI>If you have a dynamic IP, and/or write access to forward DNS only,
you can do <A HREF="#opp.client">initiate-only opportunism</A></LI>
<LI>To protect traffic bound for real IPs behind your gateway, use
<A HREF="#opp.gate">this form of full opportunism</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A name="opp.client">Initiate-only setup</A></H2>

<H3>Restrictions</H3>
<P>When you set yourself up as an opportunistic initiator:</P>
<UL>
<LI>there will be <STRONG> no incoming connection requests</STRONG>; you
 can initiate all the IPsec connections you need.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>only one machine is visible</STRONG> on your end of the
 connection.</LI>
<LI>At one point, we thought that you could also have NATted nodes behind
this machine, but this doesn't seem to work with iptables rules. Feel free
to prove us wrong.</LI>
</UL>


<H3><A name="dns.txt.client">Put your public key in DNS</A></H3>

<H4>Find a domain you can use</H4>
<P>Find a DNS forward domain where you can publish your key. 
You'll need access to the DNS zone files for that domain.  For the following 
examples, we'll use "example.com".</P>
<P>Dynamic IP users take note: the domain where you place your key
 need not be associated with the IP address for your system, 
 or even with your system's usual hostname.</P>

<H4>Choose your ID</H4>
<P>Choose a name within that domain which you will use to identify your 
 machine. Normally, but not always, your ID is the same as your machine 
name. Our machine is called xy, and we'll choose the corresponding FQDN 
xy.example.com.</P>

<H4>Create a KEY record</H4>

<P>Generate a DNS KEY record containing your system's public key
 with the command:</P>
<PRE>    ipsec showhostkey</PRE>
<P>This command takes the contents of
/etc/ipsec.secrets and reformats it into something usable by ISC's BIND.
 The result should look like this (with the key data trimmed down for
 clarity):</P>
<PRE>    ; RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    xy.example.com.   IN   KEY   0x4200 4 1 AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/</PRE>

<P>Change xy.example.com to your FQDN.</P>

<H4>Publish the KEY</H4>

<P>Insert the record into DNS, or have a system adminstrator do it
for you. It may take up to 48 hours for the record to propagate, but 
it's usually much quicker.</P>

<H3>Test that your key has been published</H3>

<H4>ipsec verify</H4>

<P>Check your DNS work</P>

<PRE>    ipsec verify</PRE>

<P>You ought to see something like:</P>

<PRE>    Looking for forward key for xy.example.com      [OK]
</PRE>

<P>For this type of opportunism, only the forward key test is relevant.</P>

<H4>...or with a direct nameserver query</H4>

<P>If your FreeS/WAN is older than 1.98b, simply query your 
nameserver (here, 1.2.3.254):
</P>
<PRE>    dig @1.2.3.254 xy.example.com KEY</PRE>

<P>You should see (with the key again shortened):</P>

<P>Put your FQDN ID, preceded by an @sign, in place of 
<VAR>@xy.example.com</VAR>. Be sure <VAR>auto=route</VAR> is enabled.</VAR>

<P>Restart FreeS/WAN so that the new configuration takes effect:</P>
<PRE>    service ipsec restart</PRE>

<P><A href="quickstart-configs.html#qc.opp.client">More information</A>.</P>

<H3>Test</H3>
<P>That's it! <A HREF=#opp.test>Test your connection</H4>.

<H2><A name="opp.incoming">Full Opportunism</A></H2>

<P>This allows you to initiate and receive opportunistic
connections from one machine.</P>

<H3><A name="incoming.opp.dns">Put KEY and TXT records in DNS</A></H3>

<H4>Your KEY record</H4>

<P>Generate a KEY record:</P>
<PRE>    ipsec showhostkey</PRE>

<P>This command takes the contents of
/etc/ipsec.secrets and reformats it into something usable by ISC's BIND.
It will yield (with key data trimmed for clarity):</P>

  xy.example.com   IN   KEY   0x4200 4 1 AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/</PRE>

<P>Edit it to insert the IP address in reverse map format.
 In our example, 1.2.3.4 becomes 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. The result:</P>

<PRE>    ; RSA 2048 bits   xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
  4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.   IN   KEY   0x4200 4 1 AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/</PRE>

<H4>Your TXT record</H4>

<P>This lets others know that this 
 machine can receive opportunistic connections. It also lets them know
 that the machine is authorized to encrypt on its own behalf.</P>

<P>Use the command:</P>
<PRE>    ipsec showhostkey --txt 1.2.3.4</PRE>
<P>where you replace 1.2.3.4 with your public IP.</P>

<P>The record (with key shortened) looks like:</P>
<PRE>    ; RSA 2048 bits  xy.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  &quot;X-IPsec-Server(10)=1.2.3.4&quot; &quot; AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/&quot;</PRE>


<H4>Publish both records</H4>

<P>Send these records to your ISP, to be published in your IP's reverse map.
It may take up to 48 hours for these to propagate, but usually takes
much less time.</P>


<H3>Test your DNS records</H3>

<P>Test that your KEY has been published by querying your nameserver 
(here, 1.2.3.254):</P>
<PRE>    dig @1.2.3.254 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. KEY</PRE>

<P>You should see (with the key shortened for clarity):</P>

    xy.example.com.		6835	IN	KEY	16896 4 1 AQO6DJc6LIwGq82ehvIGLKn4S...
</PRE>

<P>Next, test that your TXT record is visible:
<PRE>    dig @1.2.3.254 4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa. TXT</PRE>

<P>You should see (with the key shortened for clarity):</P>

<H3>Configure</H3>

<P>Find <VAR>conn me-to-anyone</VAR> in <VAR>/etc/ipsec.conf</VAR>:

<P>Adjust it to look like:</P>
<PRE>conn me-to-anyone

<P>If you've previously configured for initiator-only opportunism, remove 
<VAR>leftid=</VAR></P>
<PRE>    #leftid=xy.example.com</PRE>

<P>Restart FreeS/WAN so that it reads the new settings:</P>
<PRE>    service ipsec restart</PRE>

<P>If you are running a default install of RedHat 8.0, take note: you will
need to alter your iptables rule setup to allow IPSec traffic through your
firewall. See <A HREF="firewall.html#simple.rules">our firewall document</A>
for sample rules you can add to /etc/sysconfig/iptables to permit this.</P>

<A HREF="quickstart-configs.html#qc.incoming.opp.conf">More information.</A>

<P>That's it. Now, <A HREF=#opp.test>test your connection</H4>.

<!--
<H4><A name="incoming.opp.firewall">Firewalling incoming opportunistic
 connections</A></H4>
<P>There is a particular security concern when you allow incoming 
 opportunism.</P>
<P>Incoming opportunistic packets enter your machine via an IPSec tunnel. 
 That is, they all appear as ESP (protocol 50) packets, concealing whatever 
 port and protocol characteristics the packet within the tunnel has. Contained
 in the tunnel as they pass through <VAR>ppp0</VAR> or <VAR>eth0</VAR>, 
 these packets can bypass your usual firewall rules on these interfaces.</P>
<P>Since you will be exchanging opportunistic packets with peers who
 are not familiar to you, you will want to firewall your <VAR>ipsec</VAR> 
 interfaces the way you would any publicly accessible interface.</P>
<P>A simple way to do this is to create one iptables(8) table with 
 all your filtering rules for incoming packets, and apply the entire table to 
 all public interfaces, including <VAR>ipsec</VAR> interfaces.</P>
<A HREF="quickstart-firewall.html#quick.firewall">Here's more on firewalling

-->

<H2><A name="opp.gate">An Opportunistic Gateway</A></H2>

<H3>Start from full opportunism</H3>

Do as <A HREF="opp.incoming">above</A>, with one difference -- collect
all the DNS records you'll need before contacting your ISP.


<H3>TXT records for each protected machine</H3>

<P>You need these so that your Opportunistic peers can:
<UL>
<LI>discover the gateway's address, knowing only the IP address
 that packets are bound for</LI>
<LI>verify that the gateway is authorised to encrypt for that endpoint</LI>
</UL>

<P>On the gateway, generate a TXT record with:
<PRE>    ipsec showhostkey --txt 1.2.3.4</PRE>
<P>Use your gateway address in place of 1.2.3.4</P>

<P>You should see (keys are trimmed for clarity throughout our example):</P>
<PRE>    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  &quot;X-IPsec-Server(10)=1.2.3.4&quot; &quot; AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/&quot;</PRE>

<P><B>This MUST BE the same key as in your gateway's KEY record, or nothing
will work.</B><P>

<P>In a text file, make one copy of this TXT record for each subnet
  node:</P>
<PRE>    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  &quot;X-IPsec-Server(10)=1.2.3.4&quot; &quot; AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/&quot;

    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  &quot;X-IPsec-Server(10)=1.2.3.4&quot; &quot; AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/&quot;

    ; RSA 2048 bits  gateway.example.com   Sat Apr 15 13:53:22 2000
    IN TXT  &quot;X-IPsec-Server(10)=1.2.3.4&quot; &quot; AQOF8tZ2...+buFuFn/&quot;</PRE>

<P>Above each entry, insert a line like this:</P>
<PRE>    1.42.42.42.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR arthur.example.com</PRE>

<P>It must include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The subnet node's address in reverse map format. For example, 42.42.42.1
becomes <VAR>1.42.42.42.in-addr.arpa.</VAR>  Note the final period.</LI>
<LI><VAR>IN PTR</VAR></LI>
<LI>The node's name, ie. <VAR>arthur.example.com</VAR></LI>
</UL>

<P>The result will be a file full of TXT records, like this:</P>
