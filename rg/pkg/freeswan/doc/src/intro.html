<h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>

<p>This section gives an overview of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what IP Security (IPsec) does</li>
  <li>how IPsec works</li>
  <li>why we are implementing it for Linux</li>
  <li>how this implementation works</li>
</ul>

<p>This section is intended to cover only the essentials, <em>things you
should know before trying to use FreeS/WAN.</em></p>

<p>For more detailed background information, see the <a
href="politics.html#politics">history and politics</a> and 
<a href="ipsec.html#ipsec.detail">IPsec protocols</a> sections.</p>

<h2><a name="ipsec.intro">IPsec, Security for the Internet Protocol</a></h2>

<p>FreeS/WAN is a Linux implementation of the IPsec (IP security) protocols.
IPsec provides <a href="glossary.html#encryption">encryption</a> and <a
href="glossary.html#authentication">authentication</a> services at the IP
(Internet Protocol) level of the network protocol stack.</p>

<p>Working at this level, IPsec can protect any traffic carried over IP,
unlike other encryption which generally protects only a particular
higher-level protocol -- <a href="glossary.html#PGP">PGP</a> for mail, <a
href="glossary.html#SSH">SSH</a> for remote login, <a
href="glossary.html#SSL">SSL</a> for web work, and so on. This approach has
both considerable advantages and some limitations. For discussion, see our <a
href="ipsec.html#others">IPsec section</a></p>

<p>IPsec can be used on any machine which does IP networking. Dedicated IPsec
gateway machines can be installed wherever required to protect traffic. IPsec
can also run on routers, on firewall machines, on various application
servers, and on end-user desktop or laptop machines.</p>

<p>Three protocols are used</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#AH">AH</a> (Authentication Header) provides a
    packet-level authentication service</li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#ESP">ESP</a> (Encapsulating Security Payload)
    provides encryption plus authentication</li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#IKE">IKE</a> (Internet Key Exchange) negotiates
    connection parameters, including keys, for the other two</li>
</ul>

<p>Our implementation has three main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#KLIPS">KLIPS</a> (kernel IPsec) implements AH,
    ESP, and packet handling within the kernel</li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#Pluto">Pluto</a> (an IKE daemon) implements IKE,
    negotiating connections with other systems</li>
  <li>various scripts provide an adminstrator's interface to the
  machinery</li>
</ul>

<p>IPsec is optional for the current (version 4) Internet Protocol. FreeS/WAN
adds IPsec to the Linux IPv4 network stack. Implementations of <a
href="glossary.html#ipv6.gloss">IP version 6</a> are required to include
IPsec. Work toward integrating FreeS/WAN into the Linux IPv6 stack has <a
href="compat.html#ipv6">started</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on IPsec, see our 
<a href="ipsec.html#ipsec.detail">IPsec protocols</a> section, 
our collection of <a href="web.html#ipsec.link">IPsec
links</a> or the <a href="rfc.html#RFC">RFCs</a> which are the official
definitions of these protocols.</p>

<h3><a name="intro.interop">Interoperating with other IPsec
implementations</a></h3>

<p>IPsec is designed to let different implementations work together. We
provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <a href="web.html#implement">list</a> of some other
  implementations</li>
  <li>information on <a href="interop.html#interop">using FreeS/WAN 
  with other implementations</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The VPN Consortium fosters cooperation among implementers and
interoperability among implementations. Their <a
href="http://www.vpnc.org/">web site</a> has much more information.</p>

<h3><a name="applications">Applications of IPsec</a></h3>

<p>Because IPsec operates at the network layer, it is remarkably flexible and
can be used to secure nearly any type of Internet traffic. Two applications,
however, are extremely widespread:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <a href="glossary.html#VPN">Virtual Private Network</a>, or VPN,
    allows multiple sites to communicate securely over an insecure Internet
    by encrypting all communication between the sites.</li>
  <li>"Road Warriors" connect to the office from home, or perhaps from a
    hotel somewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>There is enough opportunity in these applications that vendors are
flocking to them. IPsec is being built into routers, into firewall products,
and into major operating systems, primarily to support these applications.
See our <a href="web.html#implement">list</a> of implementations for
details.</p>

<p>We support both of those applications, and various less common IPsec
applications as well, but we also add one of our own:</p>
<ul>
  <li>opportunistic encryption, the ability to set up FreeS/WAN gateways so
    that any two of them can encrypt to each other, and will do so whenever
    packets pass between them.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an extension we are adding to the protocols. FreeS/WAN is the
first prototype implementation, though we hope other IPsec implementations
will adopt the technique once we demonstrate it. See <a href="#goals">project
goals</a> below for why we think this is important.</p>

<p>A somewhat more detailed description of each of these applications is
below. Our <a href="quickstart.html#quick_guide">quickstart</a> section will 
show you how to build each of them.</p>

<h4><a name="makeVPN">Using secure tunnels to create a VPN</a></h4>

<p>A VPN, or <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>P</strong>rivate
<strong>N</strong>etwork lets two networks communicate securely when the only
connection between them is over a third network which they do not trust.</p>

<p>The method is to put a security gateway machine between each of the
communicating networks and the untrusted network. The gateway machines
encrypt packets entering the untrusted net and decrypt packets leaving it,
creating a secure tunnel through it.</p>

<p>If the cryptography is strong, the implementation is careful, and the
administration of the gateways is competent, then one can reasonably trust
the security of the tunnel. The two networks then behave like a single large
private network, some of whose links are encrypted tunnels through untrusted
nets.</p>

<p>Actual VPNs are often more complex. One organisation may have fifty branch
offices, plus some suppliers and clients, with whom it needs to communicate
securely. Another might have 5,000 stores, or 50,000 point-of-sale devices.
The untrusted network need not be the Internet. All the same issues arise on
a corporate or institutional network whenever two departments want to
communicate privately with each other.</p>

<p>Administratively, the nice thing about many VPN setups is that large parts
of them are static. You know the IP addresses of most of the machines
involved. More important, you know they will not change on you. This
simplifies some of the admin work. For cases where the addresses do change,
see the next section.</p>

<h4><a name="road.intro">Road Warriors</a></h4>

<p>The prototypical "Road Warrior" is a traveller connecting to home base
from a laptop machine. Administratively, most of the same problems arise for
a telecommuter connecting from home to the office, especially if the
telecommuter does not have a static IP address.</p>

<p>For purposes of this document:</p>
<ul>
  <li>anyone with a dynamic IP address is a "Road Warrior".</li>
  <li>any machine doing IPsec processing is a "gateway". Think of the
    single-user road warrior machine as a gateway with a degenerate subnet
    (one machine, itself) behind it.</li>
</ul>

<p>These require somewhat different setup than VPN gateways with static
addresses and with client systems behind them, but are basically not
problematic.</p>

<p>There are some difficulties which appear for some road warrior
connections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Road Wariors who get their addresses via DHCP may have a problem.
    FreeS/WAN can quite happily build and use a tunnel to such an address,
    but when the DHCP lease expires, FreeS/WAN does not know that. The tunnel
    fails, and the only recovery method is to tear it down and re-build
  it.</li>
  <li>If <a href="glossary.html#NAT.gloss">Network Address Translation</a>
    (NAT) is applied between the two IPsec Gateways, this breaks IPsec. IPsec
    authenticates packets on an end-to-end basis, to ensure they are not
    altered en route. NAT rewrites packets as they go by. See our <a
    href="firewall.html#NAT">firewalls</a> document for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>In most situations, however, FreeS/WAN supports road warrior connections
just fine.</p>

<h4><a name="opp.intro">Opportunistic encryption</a></h4>

<p>One of the reasons we are working on FreeS/WAN is that it gives us the
opportunity to add what we call opportuntistic encryption. This means that
any two FreeS/WAN gateways will be able to encrypt their traffic, even if the
two gateway administrators have had no prior contact and neither system has
any preset information about the other.</p>

<p>Both systems pick up the authentication information they need from the <a
href="glossary.html#DNS">DNS</a> (domain name service), the service they
already use to look up IP addresses. Of course the administrators must put
that information in the DNS, and must set up their gateways with
opportunistic encryption enabled. Once that is done, everything is automatic.
The gateways look for opportunities to encrypt, and encrypt whatever they
can. Whether they also accept unencrypted communication is a policy decision
the administrator can make.</p>

<p>This technique can give two large payoffs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It reduces the administrative overhead for IPsec enormously. You
    configure your gateway and thereafter everything is automatic. The need
    to configure the system on a per-tunnel basis disappears. Of course,
    FreeS/WAN allows specifically configured tunnels to co-exist with
    opportunistic encryption, but we hope to make them unnecessary in most
    cases.</li>
  <li>It moves us toward a more secure Internet, allowing users to create an
    environment where message privacy is the default. All messages can be
    encrypted, provided the other end is willing to co-operate. See our <a
    href="politics.html#politics">history and politics of cryptography</a> 
    section for discussion of why we think this is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Opportunistic encryption is not (yet?) a standard part of the IPsec
protocols, but an extension we are proposing and demonstrating. For details
of our design, see <a href="#applied">links</a> below.</p>

<p>Only one current product we know of implements a form of opportunistic
encryption. <a href="web.html#ssmail">Secure sendmail</a> will automatically
encrypt server-to-server mail transfers whenever possible.</p>

<h3><a name="types">The need to authenticate gateways</a></h3>

<p>A complication, which applies to any type of connection -- VPN, Road
Warrior or opportunistic -- is that a secure connection cannot be created
magically. <em>There must be some mechanism which enables the gateways to
reliably identify each other.</em> Without this, they cannot sensibly trust
each other and cannot create a genuinely secure link.</p>

<p>Any link they do create without some form of <a
href="glossary.html#authentication">authentication</a> will be vulnerable to
a <a href="glossary.html#middle">man-in-the-middle attack</a>. If <a
href="glossary.html#alicebob">Alice and Bob</a> are the people creating the
connection, a villian who can re-route or intercept the packets can pose as
Alice while talking to Bob and pose as Bob while talking to Alice. Alice and
Bob then both talk to the man in the middle, thinking they are talking to
each other, and the villain gets everything sent on the bogus "secure"
connection.</p>

<p>There are two ways to build links securely, both of which exclude the
man-in-the middle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>with <strong>manual keying</strong>, Alice and Bob share a secret key
    (which must be transmitted securely, perhaps in a note or via PGP or SSH)
    to encrypt their messages. For FreeS/WAN, such keys are stored in the <a
    href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a> file. Of course, if
    an enemy gets the key, all is lost.</li>
  <li>with <strong>automatic keying</strong>, the two systems authenticate
    each other and negotiate their own secret keys. The keys are
    automatically changed periodically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Automatic keying is much more secure, since if an enemy gets one key only
messages between the previous re-keying and the next are exposed. It is
therefore the usual mode of operation for most IPsec deployment, and the mode
we use in our setup examples. FreeS/WAN does support manual keying for
special circumstanes. See this <a
href="adv_config.html#prodman">section</a>.</p>

<p>For automatic keying, the two systems must authenticate each other during
the negotiations. There is a choice of methods for this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <strong>shared secret</strong> provides authentication. If Alice and
    Bob are the only ones who know a secret and Alice recives a message which
    could not have been created without that secret, then Alice can safely
    believe the message came from Bob.</li>
  <li>a <a href="glossary.html#public">public key</a> can also provide
    authentication. If Alice receives a message signed with Bob's private key
    (which of course only he should know) and she has a trustworthy copy of
    his public key (so that she can verify the signature), then she can
    safely believe the message came from Bob.</li>
</ul>

<p>Public key techniques are much preferable, for reasons discussed <a
href="config.html#choose">later</a>, and will be used in all our setup
examples. FreeS/WAN does also support auto-keying with shared secret
authentication. See this <a
href="adv_config.html#prodsecrets">section</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="project">The FreeS/WAN project</a></h2>

<p>For complete information on the project, see our web site, <a
href="http://liberty.freeswan.org">freeswan.org</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, we are implementing the <a
href="glossary.html#IPsec">IPsec</a> protocols for Linux and extending them
to do <a href="glossary.html#carpediem">opportunistic encryption</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="goals">Project goals</a></h3>

<p>Our overall goal in FreeS/WAN is to make the Internet more secure and more
private.</p>

<p>Our IPsec implementation supports VPNs and Road Warriors of course. Those
are important applications. Many users will want FreeS/WAN to build corporate
VPNs or to provide secure remote access.</p>

<p>However, our goals in building it go beyond that. We are trying to help
<strong>build security into the fabric of the Internet</strong> so that
anyone who choses to communicate securely can do so, as easily as they can do
anything else on the net.</p>

<p>More detailed objectives are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>extend IPsec to do <a href="glossary.html#carpediem">opportunistic
    encryption</a> so that
    <ul>
      <li>any two systems can secure their communications without a
        pre-arranged connection</li>
      <li><strong>secure connections can be the default</strong>, falling
        back to unencrypted connections only if:
        <ul>
          <li><em>both</em> the partner is not set up to co-operate on
            securing the connection</li>
          <li><em>and</em> your policy allows insecure connections</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>a significant fraction of all Internet traffic is encrypted</li>
      <li>wholesale monitoring of the net (<a
        href="politics.html#intro.poli">examples</a>) becomes difficult or
        impossible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>help make IPsec widespread by providing an implementation with no
    restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>freely available in source code under the <a
        href="glossary.html#GPL">GNU General Public License</a></li>
      <li>running on a range of readily available hardware</li>
      <li>not subject to US or other nations' <a
        href="politics.html#exlaw">export restrictions</a>.<br>
        Note that in order to avoid <em>even the appearance</em> of being
        subject to those laws, the project cannot accept software
        contributions -- <em>not even one-line bug fixes</em> -- from US
        residents or citizens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>provide a high-quality IPsec implementation for Linux
    <ul>
      <li>portable to all CPUs Linux supports: <a
        href="compat.html#CPUs">(current list)</a></li>
      <li>interoperable with other IPsec implementations: <a
        href="interop.html#interop">(current list)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we can get opportunistic encryption implemented and widely deployed,
then it becomes impossible for even huge well-funded agencies to monitor the
net.</p>

politics</a> of cryptography, which includes our project leader's <a

<h2><a name="products">Products containing FreeS/WAN</a></h2>

<p>Unfortunately the <a href="politics.html#exlaw">export laws</a> of some
countries restrict the distribution of strong cryptography. FreeS/WAN is
therefore not in the standard Linux kernel and not in all CD or web
distributions.</p>

<p>FreeS/WAN is, however, quite widely used. Products we know of that use it
are listed below. We would appreciate hearing, via the <a
href="mail.html#lists">mailing lists</a>, of any we don't know of.</p>

<h3><a name="distwith">Full Linux distributions</a></h3>

<p>FreeS/WAN is included in various general-purpose Linux distributions,
mostly from countries (shown in brackets) with more sensible laws:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE Linux</a> (Germany)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.conectiva.com">Conectiva</a> (Brazil)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/">Mandrake</a> (France)</li>
  <li>Version 3.0 of <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> will include
    FreeS/WAN. "unstable" and "test" versions already have it</li>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.pld.org.pl/">Polish(ed) Linux Distribution</a>
    (Poland)</li>
  <li><a>Best Linux</a> (Finland)</li>
</ul>

<p>For distributions which do not include FreeS/WAN and are not Redhat (which
we develop and test on), there is additional information in our <a
href="compat.html#otherdist">compatibility</a> section.</p>

<p>The server edition of <a href="http://www.corel.com">Corel</a> Linux
(Canada) also had FreeS/WAN, but Corel have dropped that product line.</p>

<h3><a name="office_dist">Office server distributions</a></h3>

<p>FreeS/WAN is also included in several distributions aimed at the market
for turnkey business servers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.e-smith.com/">e-Smith</a> (Canada), which has
    recently been acquired and become the Network Server Solutions group of
    <a href="http://www.mitel.com/">Mitel Networks</a> (Canada)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.trustix.net/">Trustix Secure Linux</a> (Norway)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.axonlinux.org/">aXon</a>, based on e-Smith
  (USA)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="fw_dist">Firewall distributions</a></h3>

<p>Several distributions intended for firewall and router applications
include FreeS/WAN:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.linuxrouter.org/">Linux Router Project</a>
    produces a Linux distribution that will boot from a single floppy. The <a
    href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net">LEAF</a> firewall project provides
    several different LRP-based firewall packages. At least one of them,
    Charles Steinkuehler's Dachstein, includes FreeS/WAN with X.509
  patches.</li>
  <li>there are several distributions bootable directly from CD-ROM, usable
    on a machine without hard disk.
    <ul>
      <li>Dachstein (see above) can be used this way</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.gibraltar.at/">Gibraltar</a> is based on Debian
        GNU/Linux.</li>
      <li>at time of writing, <a href="www.xiloo.com">Xiloo</a> is available
        only in Chinese. An English version is expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.astaro.com/products/index.html">Astaro Security
    Linux</a> includes FreeS/WAN. It has some web-based tools for managing
    the firewall that include FreeS/WAN configuration management.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.linuxwall.de">Linuxwall</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.smoothwall.org/">Smoothwall</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.devil-linux.org/">Devil Linux</a></li>
  <li>Coyote Linux has a <a
    href="http://embedded.coyotelinux.com/wolverine/index.php">Wolverine</a>
    firewall/VPN server</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also several sets of scripts available for managing a firewall
which is also acting as a FreeS/WAN IPsec gateway. See this <a
href="firewall.html#rules.pub">list</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="turnkey">Firewall and VPN products</a></h3>

<p>Several vendors use FreeS/WAN as the IPsec component of a turnkey firewall
or VPN product.</p>

<p>Software-only products:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.linuxmagic.com/vpn/index.html">Linux Magic</a>
    offer a VPN/Firewall product using FreeS/WAN</li>
  <li>The Software Group's <a
    href="http://www.wanware.com/sentinet/">Sentinet</a> product uses
    FreeS/WAN</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.merilus.com">Merilus</a> use FreeS/WAN in their
    Gateway Guardian firewall product</li>
</ul>

<p>Products that include the hardware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.lasat.com">LASAT SafePipe[tm]</a> series. is an
    IPsec box based on an embedded MIPS running Linux with FreeS/WAN and a
    web-config front end. This company also host our freeswan.org web
  site.</li>
  <li>Merilus <a
    href="http://www.merilus.com/products/fc/index.shtml">Firecard</a> is a
    Linux firewall on a PCI card.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kyzo.com/">Kyzo</a> have a "pizza box" product line
    with various types of server, all running from flash. One of them is an
    IPsec/PPTP VPN server</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pfn.com">PFN</a> use FreeS/WAN in some of their
    products</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="www.rebel.com">Rebel.com</a>, makers of the Netwinder Linux
machines (ARM or Crusoe based), had a product that used FreeS/WAN. The
company is in receivership so the future of the Netwinder is at best unclear.
<a href="web.html#patch">PKIX patches</a> for FreeS/WAN developed at Rebel
are listed in our web links document.</p>

<h3><a name="rpm.sets">RPM sets</a></h3>

<p>For some distributions which do not include FreeS/WAN, it may be possible
to install using RPM (Redhat Package Manager), rather than going through <a
href="install.html#install">our more complex procedure</a>.</p>

<p>Some caution is required on this. The RPMs are specific to a Linux
distribution and an attempt to use them on another distribution is likely to
cause problems.</p>

<p>RPMs for FreeS/WAN 1.91 and Red Hat 7.1 or 7.2 are available for download
from <a href="http://rpms.steamballoon.com/freeswan/">Steamballoon</a>. Check
there for later versions.</p>

<p>As of version 1.93, the FreeS/WAN distribution incorporates some of the
Steamballoon work, providing a facility for building your own RPMs. Details
are in our <a href="install.html#build.rpm">installation</a> document.</p>

<h2><a name="docs">Information sources</a></h2>

<h3><a name="docformats">This HowTo, in multiple formats</a></h3>

<p>FreeS/WAN documentation up to version 1.5 was available only in HTML. Now
we ship two formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li>as HTML, one file for each doc section plus a global <a
    href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a></li>
  <li><a href="HowTo.html">one big HTML file</a> for easy searching</li>
</ul>

<p>and provide a Makefile to generate other formats if required:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="HowTo.pdf">PDF</a></li>
  <li><a href="HowTo.ps">Postscript</a></li>
  <li><a href="HowTo.txt">ASCII text</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Makefile assumes the htmldoc tool is available. You can download it
from <a href="http://www.easysw.com">Easy Software</a>.</p>

<p>All formats should be available at the following websites:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.freeswan.org/doc.html">FreeS/WAN project</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org">Linux Documentation Project</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The distribution tarball has only the two HTML formats.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need the latest doc version, for example to
see if anyone has managed to set up interoperation between FreeS/WAN and
whatever, then you should download the current snapshot. What is on the web
is documentation as of the last release. Snapshots have all changes I've
checked in to date.</p>

<h3><a name="rtfm">RTFM (please Read The Fine Manuals)</a></h3>

<p>As with most things on any Unix-like system, most parts of Linux FreeS/WAN
are documented in online manual pages. We provide a list of <a
href="/mnt/floppy/manpages.html">FreeS/WAN man pages</a>, with links to HTML
versions of them.</p>

<p>The man pages describing configuration files are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/mnt/floppy/manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a></li>
  <li><a
    href="/mnt/floppy/manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">ipsec.secrets(5)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Man pages for common commands include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/mnt/floppy/manpage.d/ipsec.8.html">ipsec(8)</a></li>
  <li><a
  href="/mnt/floppy/manpage.d/ipsec_pluto.8.html">ipsec_pluto(8)</a></li>
  <li><a
    href="/mnt/floppy/manpage.d/ipsec_newhostkey.8.html">ipsec_newhostkey(8)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/mnt/floppy/manpage.d/ipsec_auto.8.html">ipsec_auto(8)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can read these either in HTML using the links above or with the
<var>man(1)</var> command.</p>

<p>In the event of disagreement between this HTML documentation and the man
pages, the man pages are more likely correct since they are written by the
implementers. Please report any such inconsistency on the <a
href="mail.html#lists">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="text">Other documents in the distribution</a></h3>

<p>Text files in the main distribution directory are README, INSTALL,
CREDITS, CHANGES, BUGS and COPYING.</p>

<p>The Libdes encryption library we use has its own documentation. You can
find it in the library directory..</p>

<h3><a name="assumptions">Background material</a></h3>

<p>Throughout this documentation, I write as if the reader had at least a
general familiarity with Linux, with Internet Protocol networking, and with
the basic ideas of system and network security. Of course that will certainly
not be true for all readers, and quite likely not even for a majority.</p>

<p>However, I must limit amount of detail on these topics in the main text.
For one thing, I don't understand all the details of those topics myself.
Even if I did, trying to explain everything here would produce extremely long
and almost completely unreadable documentation.</p>

<p>If one or more of those areas is unknown territory for you, there are
plenty of other resources you could look at:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Linux</dt>
    <dd>the <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org">Linux Documentation Project</a>
      or a local <a href="http://www.linux.org/groups/">Linux User Group</a>
      and these <a href="web.html#linux.link">links</a></dd>
  <dt>IP networks</dt>
    <dd>Rusty Russell's <a
      href="http://netfilter.samba.org/unreliable-guides/networking-concepts-HOWTO/index.html">Networking
      Concepts HowTo</a> and these <a
    href="web.html#IP.background">links</a></dd>
  <dt>Security</dt>
    <dd>Schneier's book <a href="biblio.html#secrets">Secrets and Lies</a>
      and these <a href="web.html#crypto.link">links</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>Also, I do make an effort to provide some background material in these
documents. All the basic ideas behind IPsec and FreeS/WAN are explained here.
Explanations that do not fit in the main text, or that not everyone will
need, are often in the <a href="glossary.html#ourgloss">glossary</a>, which is 
the largest single file in this document set. There is also a <a
href="background.html#background">background</a> file containing various 
explanations too long to fit in glossary definitions. All files are heavily 
sprinkled with links to each other and to the glossary. <strong>If some passage 
makes no sense to you, try the links</strong>.</p>

<p>For other reference material, see the <a
href="biblio.html#biblio">bibliography</a> and our collection of <a
href="web.html#weblinks">web links</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, no doubt I get this (and other things) wrong sometimes.
Feedback via the <a href="mail.html#lists">mailing lists</a> is welcome.</p>

<h3><a name="archives">Archives of the project mailing list</a></h3>

<p>Until quite recently, there was only one FreeS/WAN mailing list, and
archives of it were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/linux-ipsec">Canada</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nexial.com">Holland</a></li>
</ul>
The two archives use completely different search engines. You might want to
try both.

<p>More recently we have expanded to five lists, each with its own
archive.</p>

<p><a href="mail.html#lists">More information</a> on mailing lists.</p>

<h3><a name="howto">User-written HowTo information</a></h3>

<p>Various user-written HowTo documents are available. The ones covering
FreeS/WAN-to-FreeS/WAN connections are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jean-Francois Nadeau's <a href="http://jixen.tripod.com/">practical
    configurations</a> document</li>
  <li>Jens Zerbst's HowTo on <a href="http://dynipsec.tripod.com/">Using
    FreeS/WAN with dynamic IP addresses</a>.</li>
  <li>an entry in Kurt Seifried's <a
    href="http://www.securityportal.com/lskb/kben00000013.html">Linux
    Security Knowledge Base</a>.</li>
  <li>a section of David Ranch's <a
    href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#trinityos">Trinity
    OS Guide</a></li>
  <li>a section in David Bander's book <a href="biblio.html#bander">Linux
    Security Toolkit</a></li>
</ul>

<p>User-wriiten HowTo material may be <strong>especially helpful if you need
to interoperate with another IPsec implementation</strong>. We have neither
the equipment nor the manpower to test such configurations. Users seem to be
doing an admirable job of filling the gaps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>list of user-written <a href="interop.html#otherpub">interoperation
    HowTos</a> in our interop document</li>
</ul>

<p>Check what version of FreeS/WAN user-written documents cover. The software
is under active development and the current version may be significantly
different from what an older document describes.</p>

<h3><a name="applied">Papers on FreeS/WAN</a></h3>

<p>Two design documents show team thinking on new developments:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="opportunism.spec">Opportunistic Encryption</a> by technical
    lead Henry Spencer and Pluto programmer Hugh Redelemeier</li>
  <li>discussion of <a
    href="http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/SSW/freeswan/klips2req/">KLIPS
    redesign</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both documents are works in progress and are frequently revised. For the
latest version, see the <a href="mail.html#lists">design mailing list</a>. Comments
should go to that list.</p>

<p>There is now an <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-richardson-ipsec-opportunistic-06.txt">Internet
Draft on Opportunistic Encryption</a> by Michael Richardson, Hugh Redelmeier
and Henry Spencer. This is a first step toward getting the protocol
standardised so there can be multiple implementations of it. Discussion of it
takes place on the <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html">IETF IPsec
Working Group</a> mailing list.</p>

<p>A number of papers giving further background on FreeS/WAN, or exploring
its future or its applications, are also available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both Henry and Richard gave talks on FreeS/WAN at the 2000 <a
    href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org">Ottawa Linux Symposium</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Richard's <a
        href="http://www.conscoop.ottawa.on.ca/rgb/freeswan/ols2k/">slides</a></li>
      <li>Henry's paper</li>
      <li>MP3 audio of their talks is available from the <a
        href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/">conference page</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><cite>Moat: A Virtual Private Network Appliances and Services
    Platform</cite> is a paper about large-scale (a few 100 links) use of
    FreeS/WAN in a production application at AT&amp;T Research. It is
    available in Postscript or PDF from co-author Steve Bellovin's <a
    href="http://www.research.att.com/~smb/papers/index.html">papers list
    page</a>.</li>
  <li>One of the Moat co-authors, John Denker, has also written
    <ul>
      <li>a <a
        href="http://www.quintillion.com/fdis/moat/ipsec+routing/">proposal</a>
        for how future versions of FreeS/WAN might interact with routing
        protocols</li>
      <li>a <a
        href="http://www.quintillion.com/fdis/moat/wishlist.html">wishlist</a>
        of possible new features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bart Trojanowski's web page has a draft design for <a
    href="http://www.jukie.net/~bart/linux-ipsec/">hardware acceleration</a>
    of FreeS/WAN</li>
</ul>

<p>Several of these provoked interesting discussions on the mailing lists,
worth searching for in the <a href="mail.html#archive">archives</a>.</p>

<p>There are also several papers in languages other than English, see our <a
href="web.html#otherlang">web links</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="munitions">The "munitions" archive of Linux crypto
software</a></h3>

<p>There is also an archive of Linux crypto software called "munitions", with
its own mirrors in a number of countries. It includes FreeS/WAN, though not
always the latest version. Some of its sites are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://munitions.vipul.net/">Germany</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://munitions.iglu.cjb.net/">Italy</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://munitions2.xs4all.nl/">Netherlands</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any of those will have a list of other "munitions" mirrors. There is also
a CD available.</p>
