<h1><a name="compat">Linux FreeS/WAN Compatibility Guide</a></h1>

<p>Much of this document is quoted directly from the Linux FreeS/WAN <a
href="mail.html">mailing list</a>. Thanks very much to the community of
testers, patchers and commenters there, especially the ones quoted below but
also various contributors we haven't quoted.</p>

<h2><a name="spec">Implemented parts of the IPsec Specification</a></h2>

<p>In general, do not expect Linux FreeS/WAN to do everything yet. This is a
work-in-progress and some parts of the IPsec specification are not yet
implemented.</p>

<h3><a name="in">In Linux FreeS/WAN</a></h3>

<p>Things we do, as of version 1.96:</p>
<ul>
  <li>key management methods

        <dd>Automatically negotiating session keys as required. All
          connections are automatically re-keyed periodically. The <a

        <dd>Note that this technique cannot be fully secure until <a

  </li>

      <dt>group 5, modp 1536-bit</dt>
        <dd>We implement these two groups.
          <p>In negotiating a keying connection (ISAKMP SA, Phase 1) we
          propose both groups when we are the initiator, and accept either
          when a peer proposes them. Once the keying connection is made, we
          propose only the alternative agreed there for data connections
          (IPsec SA's, Phase 2) negotiated over that keying connection.</p>

        <dd>IPComp as described in RFC 2393 was added for FreeS/WAN 1.6. Note
          that Pluto becomes confused if you ask it to do IPComp when the
          kernel cannot.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All combinations of implemented transforms are supported. Note that some
form of packet-level <strong>authentication is required whenever encryption
is used</strong>. Without it, the encryption will not be secure.</p>

<h3><a name="dropped">Deliberately omitted</a></h3>
We do not implement everything in the RFCs because some of those things are
insecure. See our discussions of avoiding <a href="politics.html#weak">bogus
security</a>.

<p>Things we deliberately omit which are required in the RFCs are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>null encryption (to use ESP as an authentication-only service)</li>
  <li>single DES</li>
  <li>DH group 1, a 768-bit modp group</li>
</ul>

<p>Since these are the only encryption algorithms and DH group the RFCs
require, it is possible in theory to have a standards-conforming
implementation which will not interpoperate with FreeS/WAN. Such an
implementation would be inherently insecure, so we do not consider this a
problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, most implementations sensibly include more secure options as well,
so dropping null encryption, single DES and Group 1 does not greatly hinder
interoperation in practice.</p>

<p>We also do not implement some optional features allowed by the RFCs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>aggressive mode for negotiation of the keying channel or ISAKMP SA.
    This mode is a little faster than main mode, but exposes more information
    to an eavesdropper.</li>
</ul>

<p>In theory, this should cause no interoperation problems since all
implementations are required to support the more secure main mode, whether or
not they also allow aggressive mode.</p>

<p>In practice, it does sometimes produce problems with implementations such
as Windows 2000 where aggressive mode is the default. Typically, these are
easily solved with a configuration change that overrides that default.</p>

<h3><a name="not">Not (yet) in Linux FreeS/WAN</a></h3>

<p>Things we don't yet do, as of version 1.96:</p>
<ul>
  <li>key management methods
    <ul>
      <li>authenticate key negotiations via local <a
        href="glossary.html#PKI">PKI</a> server, but see links to user <a
        href="web.html#patch">patches</a></li>
      <li>authenticate key negotiations via <a
        href="glossary.html#SDNS">secure DNS</a></li>
      <li>unauthenticated key management, using <a
        href="glossary.html#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key agreement protocol
        without authentication. Arguably, this would be worth doing since it
        is secure against all passive attacks. On the other hand, it is
        vulnerable to an active <a
        href="glossary.html#middle">man-in-the-middle attack</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>encryption transforms
    <p>Currently <a href="glossary.html#3DES">Triple DES</a> is the only
    encryption method Pluto will negotiate.</p>
    <p>No additional encryption transforms are implemented, though the RFCs
    allow them and some other IPsec implementations support various of them.
    We are not eager to add more. See this <a
    href="faq.html#other.cipher">FAQ question</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="glossary.html#AES">AES</a>, the successor to the DES
    standard, is an excellent candidate for inclusion in FreeS/WAN, see links
    to user <a href="web.html#patch">patches</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>authentication transforms
    <p>No optional additional authentication transforms are currently
    implemented. Likely <a href="glossary.html#SHA-256">SHA-256, SHA-384 and
    SHA-512</a> will be added when AES is.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Policy checking on decrypted packets
    <p>To fully comply with the RFCs, it is not enough just to accept only
    packets which survive any firewall rules in place to limit what IPsec
    packets get in, and then pass KLIPS authentication. That is what
    FreeS/WAN currently does.</p>
    <p>We should also apply additional tests, for example ensuring that all
    packets emerging from a particular tunnel have source and destination
    addresses that fall within the subnets defined for that tunnel, and that
    packets with those addresses that did not emerge from the appropriate
    tunnel are disallowed.</p>
    <p>This will be done as part of a KLIPS rewrite. See these <a
    href="intro.html#applied">links</a> and the <a href="mail.html">design
    mailing list</a> for discussion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="pfkey">Our PF-Key implementation</a></h2>

<p>We use PF-key Version Two for communication between the KLIPS kernel code
and the Pluto Daemon. PF-Key v2 is defined by <a
href="http://www.normos.org/ietf/rfc/rfc2367.txt">RFC 2367</a>.</p>

<p>The "PF" stands for Protocol Family. PF-Inet defines a kernel/userspace
interface for the TCP/IP Internet protocols (TCP/IP), and other members of
the PF series handle Netware, Appletalk, etc. PF-Key is just a PF for
key-related matters.</p>

<h3><a name="pfk.port">PF-Key portability</a></h3>

<p>PF-Key came out of Berkeley Unix work and is used in the various BSD IPsec
implementations, and in Solaris. This means there is some hope of porting our
Pluto(8) to one of the BSD distributions, or of running their photurisd(8) on
Linux if you prefer <a href="glossary.html#photuris">Photuris</a> key
management over IKE.</p>

<p>It is, however, more complex than that. The PK-Key RFC deliberately deals
only with keying, not policy management. The three PF-Key implementations we
have looked at -- ours, OpenBSD and KAME -- all have extensions to deal with
security policy, and the extensions are different. There have been
discussions aimed at sorting out the differences, perhaps for a version three
PF-Key spec. All players are in favour of this, but everyone involved is busy
and it is not clear whether or when these discussions might bear fruit.</p>

<h2><a name="otherk">Kernels other than the latest 2.2.x and 2.4.y</a></h2>

<p>We develop and test on Redhat Linux using the most recent kernel in the
2.2 and 2.4 series. In general, we recommend you use the latest kernel in one
of those series. Complications and caveats are discussed below.</p>

<h3><a name="kernel.2.0">2.0.x kernels</a></h3>

<p>Consider upgrading to the 2.2 kernel series. If you want to stay with the
2.0 series, then we strongly recommend 2.0.39. Some useful security patches
were added in 2.0.38.</p>

<p>Various versions of the code have run at various times on most 2.0.xx
kernels, but the current version is only lightly tested on 2.0.39, and not at
all on older kernels.</p>

<p>Some of our patches for older kernels are shipped in 2.0.37 and later, so
they are no longer provided in FreeS/WAN. This means recent versions of
FreeS/WAN will probably not compile on anything earlier than 2.0.37.</p>

<h3><a name="kernel.production">2.2 and 2.4 kernels</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt>FreeS/WAN 1.0</dt>
    <dd>ran only on 2.0 kernels</dd>
  <dt>FreeS/WAN 1.1 to 1.8</dt>
    <dd>ran on 2.0 or 2.2 kernels<br>
      ran on some development kernels, 2.3 or 2.4-test</dd>
  <dt>FreeS/WAN 1.9 to 1.96</dt>
    <dd>runs on 2.0, 2.2 or 2.4 kernels</dd>
</dl>

<p>In general, <strong>we suggest the latest 2.2 kernel or 2.4 for production
use</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course no release can be guaranteed to run on kernels more recent than
it is, so quite often there will be no stable FreeS/WAN for the absolute
latest kernel. See the <a href="faq.html#k.versions">FAQ</a> for
discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="otherdist">Intel Linux distributions other than Redhat</a></h2>

<p>We develop and test on Redhat 6.1 for 2.2 kernels, and on Redhat 7.1 or
7.2 for 2.4, so minor changes may be required for other distributions.</p>

<h3><a name="rh7">Redhat 7.0</a></h3>

<p>There are some problems with FreeS/WAN on Redhat 7.0. They are soluble,
but we recommend you upgrade to a later Redhat instead..</p>

<p>Redhat 7 ships with two compilers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Their <var>gcc</var> is version 2.96. Various people, including the GNU
    compiler developers and Linus, have said fairly emphatically that using
    this was a mistake. 2.96 is a development version, not intended for
    production use. In particular, it will not compile a Linux kernel.</li>
  <li>Redhat therefore also ship a separate compiler, which they call
    <var>kgcc</var>, for compiling kernels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kernel Makefiles have <var>gcc</var> as a default, and must be adjusted to
use <var>kgcc</var> before a kernel will compile on 7.0. This mailing list
message gives details:</p>

&gt; From www.redhat.com/support/docs/gotchas/7.0/gotchas-7-6.html#ss6.1

cd to /usr/src/linux and open the Makefile in your favorite editor. You
will need to look for a line similar to this:

CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)

This line specifies which C compiler to use to build the kernel. It should
be changed to:

CC = $(CROSS_COMPILE)kgcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)

for Red Hat Linux 7. The kgcc compiler is egcs 2.91.66. From here you can
proceed with the typical compiling steps.</pre>

<h3><a name="suse">SuSE Linux</a></h3>

<p>SuSE 6.3 and later versions, at least in Europe, ship with FreeS/WAN
included.</p>

<p>Here are some notes for an earlier SuSE version.</p>

<h4>SuSE Linux 5.3</h4>
<pre>Date: Mon, 30 Nov 1998
From: Peter Onion &lt;ponion@srd.bt.co.uk&gt;

... I got Saturdays snapshot working between my two SUSE5.3 machines at home.

The mods to the install process are quite simple.  From memory and looking at
the files on the SUSE53 machine here at work....

And extra link in each of the /etc/init.d/rc?.d directories called K35ipsec
which SUSE use to shut a service down.

A few mods in /etc/init.d/ipsec  to cope with the different places that SUSE
put config info, and remove the inculsion of /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions and .
/etc/sysconfig/network as they don't exists and 1st one isn't needed anyway.

insert ". /etc/rc.config" to pick up the SUSE config info and use 

  if test -n "$NETCONFIG" -a "$NETCONFIG" != "YAST_ASK" ; then

to replace 

  [ ${NETWORKING} = "no" ] &amp;&amp; exit 0

Create /etc/sysconfig  as SUSE doesn't have one.

I think that was all (but I prob forgot something)....</pre>

<p>You may also need to fiddle initialisation scripts to ensure that
<var>/var/run/pluto.pid</var> is removed when rebooting. If this file is
present, Pluto does not come up correctly.</p>

<pre>Subject: Re: linux-IPsec: Slackware distribution
  Date:  Thu, 15 Apr 1999 12:07:01 -0700
  From:  Evan Brewer &lt;dmessiah@silcon.com&gt;

&gt; Very shortly, I will be needing to install IPsec on at least gateways that
&gt; are running Slackware. . . .

The only trick to getting it up is that on the slackware dist there is no
init.d directory in /etc/rc.d .. so create one.  Then, what I do is take the
IPsec startup script which normally gets put into the init.d directory, and
put it in /etc/rc.d and name ir rc.ipsec .. then I symlink it to the file
in init.d.  The only file in the dist you need to really edit is the
utils/Makefile, setup4:

Everything else should be just fine.</pre>

<pre>Subject: Re: HTML Docs- Need some cleanup?
   Date: Mon, 8 Jan 2001
   From: Jody McIntyre &lt;jodym@oeone.com&gt;

I have successfully installed FreeS/WAN on several Slackware 7.1 machines.
FreeS/WAN installed its rc.ipsec file in /etc/rc.d.  I had to manually call
this script from rc.inet2.  This seems to be an easier method than Evan
Brewer's.</pre>

<h3><a name="deb">Debian</a></h3>

<p>A recent (Nov 2001) mailing list points to a <a
href="http://www.thing.dyndns.org/debian/vpn.htm">web page</a> on setting up
several types of tunnel, including IPsec, on Debian.</p>

<p>Some older information:</p>

   Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1999
  From:  Tim Miller &lt;cerebus+counterpane@haybaler.sackheads.org&gt;

        Compiled and installed without error on a Debian 2.1 system
with kernel-source-2.0.36 after pointing RCDIR in utils/Makefile to
/etc/init.d.

        /var/lock/subsys/ doesn't exist on Debian boxen, needs to be
created; not a fatal error.

        Finally, IPsec scripts appear to be dependant on GNU awk
(gawk); the default Debian awk (mawk-1.3.3-2) had fatal difficulties.
With gawk installed and /etc/alternatives/awk linked to /usr/bin/gawk
operation appears flawless.</pre>

<p>The scripts in question have been modified since this was posted. Awk
versions should no longer be a problem.</p>

<pre>Subject:  Compiling FreeS/WAN 1.1 on YellowDog Linux (PPC)
   Date:  11 Dec 1999
   From:  Darron Froese &lt;darron@fudgehead.com&gt;

I'm summarizing here for the record - because it's taken me many hours to do
this (multiple times) and because I want to see IPsec on more linuxes than
just x86.

Also, I can't remember if I actually did summarize it before... ;-) I'm
working too many late hours.

That said - here goes.

1. Get your linux kernel and unpack into /usr/src/linux/ - I used 2.2.13.
&lt;http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.13.tar.bz2&gt;

2. Get FreeS/WAN and unpack into /usr/src/freeswan-1.1
&lt;ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/freeswan-1.1.tar.gz&gt;

3. Get the gmp src rpm from here:
&lt;ftp://ftp.yellowdoglinux.com//pub/yellowdog/champion-1.1/SRPMS/SRPMS/gmp-2.0.2-9a.src.rpm&gt;

4. Su to root and do this: rpm --rebuild gmp-2.0.2-9a.src.rpm

You will see a lot of text fly by and when you start to see the rpm
recompiling like this:

Executing: %build
+ umask 022
+ cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD
+ cd gmp-2.0.2
+ libtoolize --copy --force
Remember to add `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL' to `configure.in'.
You should add the contents of `/usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4' to
`aclocal.m4'.
+ CFLAGS=-O2 -fsigned-char
+ ./configure --prefix=/usr

Hit Control-C to stop the rebuild. NOTE: We're doing this because for some
reason the gmp source provided with FreeS/WAN 1.1 won't build properly on
ydl.

cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/
cp -ar gmp-2.0.2 /usr/src/freeswan-1.1/
cd /usr/src/freeswan-1.1/
rm -rf gmp
mv gmp-2.0.2 gmp

5. Open the freeswan Makefile and change the line that says:
KERNEL=$(b)zimage (or something like that) to
KERNEL=vmlinux

6. cd ../linux/

7. make menuconfig
Select an option or two and then exit - saving your changes.

8. cd ../freeswan-1.1/ ; make menugo

That will start the whole process going - once that's finished compiling,
you have to install your new kernel and reboot.

That should build FreeS/WAN on ydl (I tried it on 1.1).</pre>

The PowerMac G3 can run YDL 1.1 just fine. It should also be able to run
FreeS/WAN 1.2patch1 with a couple minor modifications:

1. In the Makefile it specifies a bzimage for the kernel compile - you have
to change that to vmlinux for the PPC.

2. The gmp source that comes with FreeS/WAN (for whatever reason) fails to
compile. I have gotten around this by getting the gmp src rpm from here:

ftp://ftp.yellowdoglinux.com//pub/yellowdog/champion-1.1/SRPMS/SRPMS/gmp-2.0.2-9a.src.rpm

If you rip the source out of there - and place it where the gmp source

<pre>Subject: Smiles on sparc and ppc
   Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2000
   From: Jake Hill &lt;jah@alien.bt.co.uk&gt;

You may or may not be interested to know that I have successfully built
FreeS/WAN on a number of non intel alpha architectures; namely on ppc
and sparc and also on osfmach3/ppc (MkLinux). I can report that it just
works, mostly, with few changes.

I have a question, before I make up some patches. I need to hack
gmp/mpn/powerpc32/*.s to build them. Is this ok? The changes are
trivial, but could I also use a different version of gmp? Is it vanilla
here?

I guess my only real headache is from ipchains, which appears to stop
running when IPsec has been started for a while. This is with 2.2.14 on
sparc.</pre>

<p>This message, from a different mailing list, may be relevant for anyone
working with FreeS/WAN on Suns:</p>

An UltraSPARC assembler version of the LibDES/SSLeay/OpenSSL des_enc.c
file is available at http://inet.uni2.dk/~svolaf/des.htm.

This brings DES on UltraSPARC from slower than Pentium at the same
clock speed to significantly faster.</pre>

<h3><a name="mips">MIPS processors</a></h3>

<p>We know FreeS/WAN runs on at least some MIPS processors because <a
href="http://www.lasat.com">Lasat</a> manufacture an IPsec box based on an
embedded MIPS running Linux with FreeS/WAN. We have no details.</p>

firewall on a PCI card, is based on a Crusoe processor and supports
FreeS/WAN.</p>

.... I have been running
uClinux with FreeS/WAN 1.4 on a system built by Moreton Bay  (
http://www.moretonbay.com )  and it was using a Coldfire processor
and was able to do the Triple DES encryption at just about
1 mbit / sec rate.......  they put a Hi/Fn 7901 hardware encryption
chip on their board and now their system does over 25 mbit of 3DES
encryption........ pretty significant increase if you ask me.</pre>

<h2><a name="multiprocessor">Multiprocessor machines</a></h2>

<p>FreeS/WAN is designed to work on SMP (symmetric multi-processing) Linux
machines and is regularly tested on dual processor x86 machines.</p>

<p>We do not know of any testing on multi-processor machines with other CPU
architectures or with more than two CPUs. Anyone who does test this, please
report results to the <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>The current design does not make particularly efficient use of
multiprocessor machines; some of the kernel work is single-threaded.</p>

<h2><a name="hardware">Support for crypto hardware</a></h2>

<p>Supporting hardware cryptography accelerators has not been a high priority
for the development team because it raises a number of fairly complex
issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can you trust the hardware? If it is not Open Source, how do you audit
    its security? Even if it is, how do you check that the design has no
    concealed traps?</li>
  <li>If an interface is added for such hardware, can that interface be
    subverted or misused?</li>
  <li>Is hardware acceleration actually a performance win? It clearly is in
    many cases, but on a fast machine it might be better to use the CPU for
    the encryption than to pay the overheads of moving data to and from a
    crypto board.</li>
  <li>the current KLIPS code does not provide a clean interface for hardware
    accelerators</li>
</ul>

<p>That said, we have a <a href="#coldfire">report</a> of FreeS/WAN working
with one crypto accelerator and some work is going on to modify KLIPS to
create a clean generic interface to such products. See this <a
href="http://www.jukie.net/~bart/linux-ipsec/">web page</a> for some of the
design discussion.</p>

<p>More recently, a patch to support some hardware accelerators has been
posted:</p>
<pre>Subject: [Design] [PATCH] H/W acceleration patch
   Date: Tue, 18 Sep 2001
   From: "Martin Gadbois" &lt;martin.gadbois@colubris.com&gt;
 
Finally!!
Here's a web site with H/W acceleration patch for FreeS/WAN 1.91, including
S/W and Hifn 7901 crypto support.

Martin Gadbois</pre>

<p>Hardware accelerators could take performance well beyond what FreeS/WAN
can do in software (discussed <a href="performance.html">here</a>). Here is
some discussion off the IETF IPsec list, October 2001:</p>
<pre> ... Currently shipping chips deliver, 600 mbps throughput on a single
 stream of 3DES IPsec traffic.  There are also chips that use multiple
 cores to do 2.4 gbps.  We (Cavium) and others have announced even faster
 chips. ... Mid 2002 versions will handle at line rate (OC48 and OC192)
 IPsec and SSL/TLS traffic not only 3DES CBC but also AES and arc4.</pre>

<p>The patches to date support chips that have been in production for some
time, not the state-of-the-art latest-and-greatest devices described in that
post. However, they may still outperform software and they almost certainly
reduce CPU overhead.</p>

<h2><a name="ipv6">IP version 6 (IPng)</a></h2>

<p>The Internet currently runs on version four of the IP protocols. IPv4 is
what is in the standard Linux IP stack, and what FreeS/WAN was built for. In
IPv4, IPsec is an optional feature.</p>

<p>The next version of the IP protocol suite is version six, usually
abbreviated either as "IPv6" or as "IPng" for "IP: the next generation". For
IPv6, IPsec is a required feature. Any machine doing IPv6 is required to
support IPsec, much as any machine doing (any version of) IP is required to
support ICMP.</p>

<p>There is a Linux implementation of IPv6 in Linux kernels 2.2 and above.
For details, see the <a
href="http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/systems/linux/faq/">FAQ</a>. It
does not yet support IPsec. The <a
href="http://www.linux-ipv6.org/">USAGI</a> project are also working on IPv6
for Linux.</p>

<p>FreeS/WAN was originally built for the current standard, IPv4, but we are
interested in seeing it work with IPv6. Some progress has been made, and a
patched version with IPv6 support is <a
href="http://www.ipv6.iabg.de/downloadframe/index.html">available</a>. For
more recent information, check the <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="v6.back">IPv6 background</a></h3>

<p>IPv6 has been specified by an IETF <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipngwg-charter.html">working
group</a>. The group's page lists over 30 RFCs to date, and many Internet
Drafts as well. The overview is <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt">RFC 2460</a>. Major features
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>expansion of the address space from 32 to 128 bits,</li>
  <li>changes to improve support for
    <ul>
      <li>mobile IP</li>
      <li>automatic network configuration</li>
      <li>quality of service routing</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>improved security via IPsec</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of projects are working on IPv6 implementation. A prominent Open
Source effort is <a href="http://www.kame.net/">KAME</a>, a collaboration
among several large Japanese companies to implement IPv6 for Berkeley Unix.
Other major players are also working on IPv6. For example, see pages at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
  href="http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html">Sun</a></li>
  <li><a
  href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/732/ipv6/index.html">Cisco</a></li>
  <li><a
    href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/howitworks/communications/networkbasics/IPv6.asp">Microsoft</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.6bone.net/">6bone</a> (IPv6 backbone) testbed
network has been up for some time. There is an active <a
href="http://www.ipv6.org/">IPv6 user group</a>.</p>

<p>One of the design goals for IPv6 was that it must be possible to convert
from v4 to v6 via a gradual transition process. Imagine the mess if there
were a "flag day" after which the entire Internet used v6, and all software
designed for v4 stopped working. Almost every computer on the planet would
need major software changes! There would be huge costs to replace older
equipment. Implementers would be worked to death before "the day", systems
administrators and technical support would be completely swamped after it.
The bugs in every implementation would all bite simultaneously. Large chunks
of the net would almost certainly be down for substantial time periods.
...</p>

<p>Fortunately, the design avoids any "flag day". It is therefore a little
tricky to tell how quickly IPv6 will take over. The transition has certainly
begun. For examples, see announcements from <a
href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/internet2/2000-03/0016.html">NTT</a>
and <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1102383">Nokia</a>. However, it is
not yet clear how quickly the process will gain momentum, or when it will be
completed. Likely large parts of the Internet will remain with IPv4 for years
to come.</p>
