<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Barf</I>

outputs (on standard output) a collection of debugging information
(contents of files, selections from logs, etc.)
related to the IPsec encryption/authentication system.
It is primarily a convenience for remote debugging,
a single command which packages up (and labels) all information
that might be relevant to diagnosing a problem in IPsec.
<P>

<I>Look</I>

outputs a minimal subset of this,
intended as a quick look at current connections and related information,
in a somewhat less self-explanatory format optimized for terseness.
<P>

The
<B>--short</B>

option limits the length of
the log portion of
<I>barf</I>'s

output, which can otherwise be extremely voluminous
if debug logging is turned on.
<P>

<I>Barf</I>

censors its output,
replacing keys
and secrets with brief checksums to avoid revealing sensitive information.
<I>Look</I>

output does not contain such information.
<P>

Beware that the output of both commands is aimed at humans,
not programs,
and the output format is subject to change without warning.
<P>

<I>Barf</I>

has to figure out which files in
<I>/var/log</I>

contain the IPsec log messages.
It looks for KLIPS and general log messages first in
<I>messages</I>

and
<I>syslog</I>,

and for Pluto messages first in
<I>secure</I>,

<I>auth.log</I>,

and
<I>debug</I>.

In both cases,
if it does not find what it is looking for in one of those ``likely'' places,
it will resort to a brute-force search of most (non-compressed) files in
<I>/var/log</I>.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<I>Barf</I>

uses heuristics to try to pick relevant material out of the logs,
and relevant messages
which are not labelled with any of the tags that
<I>barf</I>

looks for will be lost.
We think we've eliminated the last such case, but one never knows...
<P>

Finding
<I>updown</I>

scripts (so they can be included in output) is, in general, difficult.
<I>Barf</I>

uses a very simple heuristic that is easily fooled.
<P>

The brute-force search for the right log files can get expensive on
systems with a lot of clutter in
<I>/var/log</I>.
