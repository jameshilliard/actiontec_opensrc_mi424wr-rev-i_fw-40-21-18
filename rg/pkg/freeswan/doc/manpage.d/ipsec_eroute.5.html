<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>/proc/net/ipsec_eroute</I>

lists the IPSEC extended routing tables,
which control what (if any) processing is applied
to non-encrypted packets arriving for IPSEC processing and forwarding.
At this point it is a read-only file.
<P>

A table entry consists of:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>+<DD>
packet count,
<DT>+<DD>
source address with mask,
<DT>+<DD>
a '-&gt;' separator for visual and automated parsing between src and dst
<DT>+<DD>
destination address with mask
<DT>+<DD>
a '=&gt;' separator for visual and automated parsing between selection
criteria and SAID to use
<DT>+<DD>
SAID (Security Association IDentifier), comprised of:
<DT>+<DD>
protocol
(<I>proto</I>),
<DT>+<DD>
address family
(<I>af</I>),
where '.' stands for IPv4 and ':' for IPv6
<DT>+<DD>
Security Parameters Index
(<I>SPI</I>),
<DT>+<DD>
effective destination
(<I>edst</I>),
where the packet should be forwarded after processing
(normally the other security gateway)
together indicate which Security Association should be used to process
the packet,
<DT>+<DD>
source identity text string with no whitespace, in parens,
<DT>+<DD>
destination identity text string with no whitespace, in parens
</DL>
<P>

Addresses are written as IPv4 dotted quads or IPv6 coloned hex,
protocol is one of &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;esp&quot;, &quot;comp&quot; or &quot;tun&quot;
and
SPIs are prefixed hexadecimal numbers where the prefix '.' is for IPv4 and the prefix ':' is for IPv6
<P>

SAIDs are written as &quot;<A HREF="mailto:protoafSPI@edst">protoafSPI@edst</A>&quot;.  There are also 5
&quot;magic&quot; SAIDs which have special meaning:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>+<DD>
<B>%drop</B>

means that matches are to be dropped
<DT>+<DD>
<B>%reject</B>

means that matches are to be dropped and an ICMP returned, if
possible to inform
<DT>+<DD>
<B>%trap</B>

means that matches are to trigger an ACQUIRE message to the Key
Management daemon(s) and a hold eroute will be put in place to
prevent subsequent packets also triggering ACQUIRE messages.
<DT>+<DD>
<B>%hold</B>

means that matches are to stored until the eroute is replaced or
until that eroute gets reaped
<DT>+<DD>
<B>%pass</B>

means that matches are to allowed to pass without IPSEC processing

that has been set up to protect traffic between the subnet
<B>172.31.252.0</B>
