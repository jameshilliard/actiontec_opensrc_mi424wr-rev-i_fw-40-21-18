	spooky action bug
	2001-11-09
011211		respect DF bit
		ICMP rate limited
			my system
			by destination, most memory intensive
			rate limit by SA
		write FS ICMP/MTU policy
		mess around with dst cache MSS
	fordhr:	enforce 4k msg limit.
	fix pfkey_update:new tdb should add to, not replace original: oe lifespan
	implement self-documenting kernel code:
		http://kernelbook.sourceforge.net/#kdocs
	replace IKE bypass machinery with SPD entries.
	implement eroute reject IMCP "communication administratively prohibited"
	fix lifetime_byte_c len/ilen assignment
	IPCOMP frag-in-clear?
	pick-next-less-specific-eroute for intermediate tunnel lookup
		for IKE passthrough.
	sparc64:klips/net/ipsec/ipsec_tunnel.c:2106/2912:
		only 16B copied, 32 required, see:
		arch/sparc64/kernel/ioctl32.c:450/3806:dev_ifname32()
	BUGS: order of spigrp options somewhat important. debug before all
	leakage on ipsec startup?
	xbone compatibility
	2.0.xx problems reported with LFS1.1: MTU/fragmentation, instability.
	0/0 - extruded subnets on 2.2
	denker and crashing moats, NMI board from denker
	timeout SA after configured time of non-use

Features:
	UML test bench and battery of tests
	dhr tunnel patch
	AES
	SHA-256/384/512 hashes

Priorities and resources:
	- finish pfkeyv2
	- discussions with OpenBSD and KAME
HS:
	- research for spd decision, spd decision
	- sharing SAs not mandatory, but perhaps desirable?
DHR:
	- include community code
	- ipv6
RGB:
	- minidenker - different IP address on ipsec I/F than attached I/F
	- inbound eroute/subnet checking for DHR
	- klips2 design
		advanced policy routing from HS
		netfilter
		netgraph

2.3 merge comments from dmiller:
	non-US contribution policy big problem
2.3 merge comments from ankuznetsov:
	remove deprecated sklist_{insert,remove,destroy}_socket() calls
	defconfig?
	ditch compiler directives
	kill $Log
	kill BSD radix code
2.3 merge comments from akleen:
	modular not reason for putting in main tree
	use the routing table for security policy
	do transport mode early in packet creation
	handle MTU handling more cleanly
	violates layering
	non-US contribution policy big problem
	as of 2.3.xx init calls are not necessary
		type __init function(){}
		type __exit function(){}

Features for 1.0: klips kernel
Most	Provide more useful error messages from kernel
Most	Sanitize klips headers for use above and below kernel/user I/F.
Part	#defines for kernel constants ie. hash function magic numbers, etc.
1.0	Clear all eroutes and spis when last ipsec device is ifconfiged down.
	Per-bundle debugging.
	Per-SA statistics via /proc/net/ipsec_spi:
		total late/lost

Features for 1.0: klips utils
	Errors:  what is wrong, where in code, what can't do, what is fix
	Use consistent units: ie. hex digits, bytes or bits.
Most	Include 'ipsec' prefix in all manual utils calls in test scripts

Features for 1.0: klips documentation
	Xform to standards/doc_draft_refs mapping in source header comments
	Create HOWTO-debug_IPSEC (troubleshooting guide)
	Mobile-ipsec

Features for 1.0: general
1.1	Audit for info leaks
1.1	Audit for specs
1.1	Audit for bugs ?!?
HS?	Make 'check' (gnu coding standard, make, make check, make install)
	Errors: when,who,to whom,what,what can't do,what is wrong,how to fix   
	error reporting: (1) programmer's debugging (2) user's debugging
	GNATS DB -- HS?

1.6
	opportunistic
	PF_KEYv2:
		socket functions:
			signal userspace process (use select on listening processes) (written, needs testing)
		parse extension types:
			ident (written, needs testing)
			sens (written, needs testing)
			prop (written, needs testing)
			supported (written, needs testing)
			x_kmprivate
		parse message types, in kernel:
			get (written, needs testing)
			acquire (written, needs testing)
			register (written, needs testing)
			expire (written, needs testing)
			dump
			x_promisc
			x_pchange
		initiate message types, in kernel:

Most	Expire SA's on soft/hard time/seq/qty and signal user (pfkey) (written, needs testing)
GG	Port to IPv6
	satot() conversion for /proc spi display
	xlen, skb->len review for bogus packets, skb->len must be larger than ip->totlen

	Add processing for IP options in outgoing and incoming packets
		(rfc2402, 3.3.3.1.1.2, appendix A)
	Add support for userspace udp/500 blasting at selected port number. (SPD)
