\subsection{005: routing below tunnel layer to support mobility and multi-homing}

\label{req005}

\subsubsection{005: Definition of requirement }

Ciphertext packets should be treated like all other packets, and should be
subject to normal routing proceedures.

\subsubsection{005: Response}

Implementation of MAST devices and packet escalator should accomplish this.

This is a critical piece for reliability of opportunistic encryption, as
current routing tricks cause plaintext packets to blackhole after a physical
interface flap.
