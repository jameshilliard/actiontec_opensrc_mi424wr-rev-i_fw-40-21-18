\subsection{011: granularity smaller than host}

\label{req011}

\subsubsection{011: Definition of requirement }

It is desired to do SPD lookups based upon UDP/TCP port numbers (source and
destination) as well as source and destination address.

In addition, for hosts a lookup based upon Unix UID should be possible.

For gateways, it is also desirable to do lookup based upon IPSO labels.

\subsubsection{011: response}

UDP/TCP port number lookups will be present in the second release of KLIPS2.

IPSO labels will be present in the third release of KLIPS2.
