\subsection{026: use a refcount on each SA to increase locking granularity}

\subsubsection{026: Definition of requirement }

Each SA object will use reference counts to determine when it may be freed.

The SAs will be referenced from eroute's via an indirection table, reducing
the need to search by SAID, yet not introducing new pointers that may not be
easy to find. This same index will occur in {\tt skb->nfmark} references.
