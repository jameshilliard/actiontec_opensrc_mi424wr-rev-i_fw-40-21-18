\subsection{018: full inbound policy checking}

\subsubsection{018: Definition of requirement }

Upon decryption/decapsulation of a packet, the inner set of selectors should
be checked against SA definition. This is a requirement from RFC2401. It
provides a paranoid check against possible mis-behaviour/mis-configuration of
a corresponding peer.

\subsubsection{018: response}

This will be present in the 1.92 release.

This facility will be present in the KLIPS2 design as an optional feature.
