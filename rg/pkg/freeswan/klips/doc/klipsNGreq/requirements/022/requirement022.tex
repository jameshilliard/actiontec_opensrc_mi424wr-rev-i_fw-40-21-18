\subsection{022: free of export restrictions}

\subsubsection{022: Definition of requirement }

Many countries have placed restrictions on what their citizens may do, or
having done this, may restrict who the product may be given to. The project's 
code should not be encumbered in this manner.

\subsubsection{022: response}

The project will continue to refuse contributions from residents or citizens
of the United States of America. The recent changes to the administration of
the BXA are not sufficient cause change this policy as they may change again
very quickly.
