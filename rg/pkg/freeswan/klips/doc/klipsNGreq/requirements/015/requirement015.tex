\subsection{015: KLIPS as a loadable module (isn't it already?)}

\subsubsection{015: Definition of requirement }

The KLIPS system should permit compilation as a loadable module to permit easy
intregration.

\subsubsection{015: response}

This requirement is currently met in KLIPS1, and will be retained for future
work.

While LKM is a permitted configuration, it must always be possible to compile 
the module statically.
