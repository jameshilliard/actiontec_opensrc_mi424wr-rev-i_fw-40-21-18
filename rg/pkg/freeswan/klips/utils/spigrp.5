.SH NAME
ipsec_spigrp \- list IPSEC Security Association groupings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipsec
.B spigrp
.PP
.B cat
.B /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp
is a read-only file that lists groups of IPSEC Security Associations
(SAs).
.PP
An entry in the IPSEC extended routing table can only point (via an
SAID) to one SA.  If more than one transform must be applied to a given
type of packet, this can be accomplished by setting up several SAs with
the same destination address but potentially different SPIs and
protocols, and grouping them with
.IR ipsec_spigrp(8) .
.PP
The SA groups are listed, one line per connection/group, as a sequence
of SAs to be applied (or that should have been applied, in the case of
an incoming packet) from inside to outside the packet.  An SA is
identified by its SAID, which consists of protocol ("ah", "esp", "comp" or
"tun"), SPI (with '.' for IPv4 or ':' for IPv6 prefixed hexadecimal number ) and destination address
(IPv4 dotted quad or IPv6 coloned hex) prefixed by '@', in the format <proto><af><spi>@<dest>.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B tun.3d0@192.168.2.110
.B comp.3d0@192.168.2.110
.B esp.187a101b@192.168.2.110
.B ah.187a101a@192.168.2.110 
.LP
is a group of 3 SAs, destined for 
.BR 192.168.2.110
with an IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel SA applied first with an SPI of
.BR 3d0
in hexadecimal, followed by a Deflate compression header to compress
the packet with CPI of
.BR 3d0
in hexadecimal, followed by an Encapsulating Security Payload header to
encrypt the packet with SPI
.BR 187a101b
in hexadecimal, followed by an Authentication Header to authenticate the
packet with SPI
.BR 187a101a
in hexadecimal, applied from inside to outside the packet.  This could
be an incoming or outgoing group, depending on the address of the local
machine.

.TP
.B tun:3d0@3049:1::2
.B comp:3d0@3049:1::2
.B esp:187a101b@3049:1::2
.B ah:187a101a@3049:1::2 
.LP
is a group of 3 SAs, destined for 
.BR 3049:1::2
with an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel SA applied first with an SPI of
.BR 3d0
in hexadecimal, followed by a Deflate compression header to compress
the packet with CPI of
.BR 3d0
in hexadecimal, followed by an Encapsulating Security Payload header to
encrypt the packet with SPI
.BR 187a101b
in hexadecimal, followed by an Authentication Header to authenticate the
packet with SPI
.BR 187a101a
in hexadecimal, applied from inside to outside the packet.  This could
be an incoming or outgoing group, depending on the address of the local
machine.
