.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Spigrp
groups IPSEC Security Associations (SAs) together or ungroups
previously grouped SAs.
An entry in the IPSEC extended
routing table can only point
(via a destination address, a Security Parameters Index (SPI) and
a protocol identifier) to one SA.
If more than one transform must be applied to a given type of packet,
this can be accomplished by setting up several SAs
with the same destination address but potentially different SPIs and protocols,
and grouping them with
.IR spigrp .
.PP
The SAs to be grouped,
specified by destination address (DNS name lookup, IPv4 dotted quad or IPv6 coloned hex), SPI
('0x'-prefixed hexadecimal number) and protocol ("ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun"),
are listed from the inside transform to the
outside;
in other words, the transforms are applied in
the order of the command line and removed in the reverse
order.
The resulting SA group is referred to by its first SA (by
.IR af1 ,
.IR dst1 ,
.IR spi1
and
.IR proto1 ).
.PP
The \-\-said option indicates that the SA IDs are to be specified as
one argument each, in the format <proto><af><spi>@<dest>.  The SA IDs must
all be specified as separate parameters without the \-\-said option or
all as monolithic parameters after the \-\-said option.
.PP
The SAs must already exist and must not already
be part of a group.
.PP
If
.I spigrp
is invoked with only one SA specification,
it ungroups the previously-grouped set of SAs containing
the SA specified.
.PP
The \-\-label option identifies all responses from that command
invocation with a user-supplied label, provided as an argument to the
label option.  This can be helpful for debugging one invocation of the
command out of a large number.
.PP
The command form with no additional arguments lists the contents of
/proc/net/ipsec_spigrp.  The format of /proc/net/ipsec_spigrp is
discussed in ipsec_spigrp(5).
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B ipsec spigrp inet gw2 0x113 tun inet gw2 0x115 esp inet gw2 0x116 ah
groups 3 SAs together, all destined for
.BR gw2 ,
but with an IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel SA applied first with SPI
.BR 0x113 ,
then an ESP header to encrypt the packet with SPI
.BR 0x115 ,
and finally an AH header to authenticate the packet with SPI
.BR 0x116 .
.LP
.TP
.B ipsec spigrp --said tun.113@gw2 esp.115@gw2 ah.116@gw2 
groups 3 SAs together, all destined for

but with an IPv4-in-IPv4 tunnel SA applied first with SPI
.BR 0x113 ,
then an ESP header to encrypt the packet with SPI
.BR 0x115 ,

.BR 3049:1::1,
but with an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel SA applied first with SPI

.SH BUGS
Yes, it really is limited to a maximum of four SAs,
although admittedly it's hard to see why you would need more.
