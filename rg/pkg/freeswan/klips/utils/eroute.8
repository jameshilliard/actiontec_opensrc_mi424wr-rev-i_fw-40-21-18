.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Eroute
manages the IPSEC extended routing tables,
which control what (if any) processing is applied
to non-encrypted packets arriving for IPSEC processing and forwarding.
The form with no additional arguments lists the contents of
/proc/net/ipsec_eroute.
The
.B \-\-add
form adds a table entry, the
.B \-\-replace
form replaces a table entry, while the
.B \-\-del
form deletes one.  The
.B \-\-clear
form deletes the entire table.
.PP
A table entry consists of:
.IP + 3
source and destination addresses,
with masks, source and destination ports and protocol
for selection of packets.  The source and destination ports are only
legal if the transport protocol is
.BR TCP
or
.BR UDP.
A port can be specified as either decimal, hexadecimal (leading 0x),
octal (leading 0) or a name listed in the first column of /etc/services.
A transport protocol can be specified as either decimal, hexadecimal
(leading 0x), octal (leading 0) or a name listed in the first column
of /etc/protocols.  If a transport protocol or port is not specified
then it defaults to 0 which means all protocols or all ports
respectively.
.IP +
Security Association IDentifier, comprised of:
.IP + 6
protocol
(\fIproto\fR), indicating (together with the
effective destination and the security parameters index)
which Security Association should be used to process the packet
.IP +
address family
(\fIaf\fR),
.IP +
Security Parameters Index
(\fIspi\fR), indicating (together with the
effective destination and protocol)
which Security Association should be used to process the packet
(must be larger than or equal to 0x100)
.IP +
effective destination
(\fIedst\fR),
where the packet should be forwarded after processing
(normally the other security gateway)
.IP + 3
OR
.IP + 6
SAID
(\fIsaid\fR), indicating 
which Security Association should be used to process the packet
.PP
Addresses are written as IPv4 dotted quads or IPv6 coloned hex,
protocol is one of "ah", "esp", "comp" or "tun" and SPIs are
prefixed hexadecimal numbers where '.' represents IPv4 and ':'
stands for IPv6.
.PP
SAIDs are written as "protoafSPI@address".  There are also 5
"magic" SAIDs which have special meaning:
.IP + 3
.B %drop
means that matches are to be dropped
.IP +
.B %reject
means that matches are to be dropped and an ICMP returned, if
possible to inform
.IP +
.B %trap
means that matches are to trigger an ACQUIRE message to the Key
Management daemon(s) and a hold eroute will be put in place to
prevent subsequent packets also triggering ACQUIRE messages.
.IP +
.B %hold
means that matches are to stored until the eroute is replaced or
until that eroute gets reaped
.IP +
.B %pass
means that matches are to allowed to pass without IPSEC processing
.PP
The format of /proc/net/ipsec_eroute is listed in ipsec_eroute(5).

.br
.B "   \-\-spi 0x135 \-\-proto tun"
.LP
sets up an
.BR eroute
on a Security Gateway to protect traffic between the host
.BR 192.168.0.1
and the subnet
.BR 192.168.2.0
with
.BR 24
bits of subnet mask via Security Gateway
.BR 192.168.0.2
using the Security Association with address
.BR 192.168.0.2 ,
Security Parameters Index
.BR 0x135
and protocol
.BR tun
(50, IPPROTO_ESP).
.LP
.B "ipsec eroute \-\-add \-\-eraf inet6 \-\-src 3049:1::1/128 \e"
.br
.B "   \-\-dst 3049:2::/64 \-\-af inet6 \-\-edst 3049:1::2 \e"
.br
.B "   \-\-spi 0x145 \-\-proto tun"
.LP
sets up an
.BR eroute
on a Security Gateway to protect traffic between the host
.BR 3049:1::1
and the subnet
.BR 3049:2::
with
.BR 64
bits of subnet mask via Security Gateway
.BR 3049:1::2
using the Security Association with address
.BR 3049:1::2 ,
Security Parameters Index
.BR 0x145
and protocol
.BR tun
(50, IPPROTO_ESP).
.LP
.B "ipsec eroute \-\-replace \-\-eraf inet \-\-src company.com/24 \e"
.br
.B "   \-\-dst ftp.ngo.org/32 \-\-said tun.135@gw.ngo.org"
.LP
replaces an
.BR eroute
on a Security Gateway to protect traffic between the subnet
.BR company.com 
with
.BR 24
bits of subnet mask and the host
.BR ftp.ngo.org
via Security Gateway
.BR gw.ngo.org
using the Security Association with Security Association ID
.BR tun0x135@gw.ngo.org
.LP
.B "ipsec eroute \-\-del \-\-eraf inet \-\-src company.com/24 \e"
.br
.B "   \-\-dst www.ietf.org/32 \-\-said %passthrough4"
.LP
deletes an
.BR eroute
on a Security Gateway that allowed traffic between the subnet
.BR company.com 
with
.BR 24
bits of subnet mask and the host
.BR www.ietf.org
to pass in the clear, unprocessed.
.LP
.B "ipsec eroute \-\-add \-\-eraf inet \-\-src company.com/24 \e"
.br
.B "   \-\-dst mail.ngo.org/32 \-\-transport-proto 6 \e"
.br
.B "   \-\-dst\-port 110 \-\-said tun.135@mail.ngo.org"
.LP
sets up an 
.BR eroute
on on a Security Gateway to protect only TCP traffic on port 110
(pop3) between the subnet
.BR company.com 
with
.BR 24
bits of subnet mask and the host
.BR ftp.ngo.org
via Security Gateway
.BR mail.ngo.org
using the Security Association with Security Association ID
.BR tun0x135@mail.ngo.org.
Note that any other traffic bound for
.BR mail.ngo.org
that is routed via the ipsec device will be dropped.  If you wish to
allow other traffic to pass through then you must add a %pass rule.
For example the following rule when combined with the above will
ensure that POP3 messages read from
.BR mail.ngo.org
will be encrypted but all other traffic to/from
.BR mail.ngo.org
will be in clear text.
