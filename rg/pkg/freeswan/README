This is release 1.99 of Linux FreeS/WAN, our freely-redistributable IPsec
implementation.  See http://www.freeswan.org for current news and pointers
to more recent releases (if any).  The BUGS file lists bugs that we
consider major, and the CHANGES file lists the major things that have been
done since the last release; READ BOTH before installing. 

The current development and target system for FreeS/WAN is Red Hat 7.3
with either a current Red Hat kernel or 2.4.18. This is gradually
shifting to Red Hat 8.0.

We do not test with 2.0 kernels earlier than 2.0.39.

We do not support obsolete kernels (e.g. 2.2.xx, xx < 20), and using them 
is generally a bad idea anyway.

It's likely to work with other Linux distributions using 2.2.xx or 2.4.xx
kernels; if modifications are necessary, please tell us details, and we'll
try to fix it so it'll drop in cleanly in future.  Other systems are a
lower priority but we'd still like to hear details if you try it. 

Several high-level documents are in the doc directory.  Most are in HTML
format; do

	lynx doc/index.html

(or use your own favorite HTML reader) to read them.  See doc/README for
two methods of getting plain-text versions if needed.  See doc/roadmap.html
for a guide to what's where in this distribution. 

Unpacking the distribution needs about 12MB, and compiling it perhaps
another 50MB.  For setup procedures, start at doc/intro.html; the INSTALL
file is now intended for experts only. 

Please also see doc/makecheck.html for information on automated regression
testing.

Feedback is welcome, preferably (for legal reasons, among others) to the
users mailing list (see http://www.freeswan.org/mail.html to subscribe).
(Caution:  that mailing list goes all over the world.  If you are located
in the US, or are a US citizen, read doc/politics.html before sending
mail!)  If you're reporting a problem with the software, we ask that you
read doc/trouble.html first. 

The form "ipsec send-pr" may be used to report bugs directly to our
tracking system. You may review tham at http://bugs.freeswan.org:81/
Bug reports SHOULD include a reference to the output of "ipsec barf"
(it is big, so put it on a stable web site), and way to reproduce the bug.
If the bug can not be reproduced, we are unlikely to even reply.
