/**
 * Initialize RFC 3706 Dead Peer Detection
 *
 * @param st An initialized state structure
 * @return void
 *
 * How DPD works.
 *
 * There are two kinds of events that can be scheduled.
 * At most one of them is schedule at any given time.
 *
 * The EVENT_DPD_TIMEOUT event, if it ever goes off, means that
 * neither the ISAKMP SA nor the IPsec SA has *RECEIVED* any DPD
 * events lately.
 *
 * 0) So, every time we receive a DPD (R_U_THERE or R_U_ACK), then
 *    we delete any DPD event (EVENT_DPD or EVENT_DPD_TIMEOUT), and
 *    we schedule a new DPD_EVENT (sending) for "delay" in the future.
 *
 * 1) When the DPD_EVENT goes off, we check the phase 2 (if there is one)
 *    SA to see if there was incoming traffic. If there was, then we are happy,
 *    we set a new DPD_EVENT, and we are done.
 *
 * 2) If there was no phase 2 activity, we check if there was a recent enough
 *    DPD activity (st->st_last_dpd). If so, we just reschedule, and do
 *    nothing.
 *
 * 3) Otherwise, we send a DPD R_U_THERE message, and set the
 *    EVENT_DPD_TIMEOUT on the phase 1.
 *
 * One thing to realize when looking at "ipsec whack --listevents" output,
 * is there there will only be DPD_EVENT_TIMEOUT events if there are
 * outstanding R_U_THERE messages.
 *
 * The above is the basic idea, but things are a bit more complicated because
 * multiple phase 2s can share the same phase 1 ISAKMP SA. Each phase 2 state
 * has its own DPD_EVENT. Further, we start a DPD_EVENT for phase 1 when it
 * gets established. This is because the phase 2 may never actually succeed
 * (usually due to authorization issues, which may be DNS or otherwise related)
 * and if the responding end dies (gets restarted, or the conn gets reloaded
 * with the right policy), then we may have a bum phase 1 SA, and we can not
 * re-negotiate. (This happens WAY too often)
 *
 * The phase 2 dpd_init() will attempt to kill the phase 1 DPD_EVENT, if it
 * can, to reduce the amount of work. 
 *
 * The st_last_dpd member which is used is always the one from the phase 1.
 * So, if there are multiple phase 2s, then if any of them receive DPD data
 * they will update the st_last_dpd, so the test in #2 will avoid the traffic
 * for all by one phase 2. 
 * 
 * Note that the EVENT_DPD are attached to phase 2s (typically), while the
 * EVENT_DPD_TIMEOUT are attached to phase 1s only.
 *
 * Finally, if the connection is using NAT-T, then we ignore the phase 2
 * activity check, because in the case of a unidirectional stream (VoIP for
 * a conference call, for instance), we may not send enough traffic to keep
 * the NAT port mapping valid.
