This is the start of a test jig for Pluto.

You should add `pwd`/bin to PATH.  It contains the testing scripts.

bin/CONFIG specifies configuration details for all the scripts.

Since the testing uses information from the Domain Name System, a
couple of zones must be added to the name server:  test.zone and
test.rev.zone.  Each of these zone files includes comments as to what
changes need to be made to /etc/named.conf.

The only script that needs superuser privileges is bin/ifconfigs.  This
sets up aliases to interface lo for testing.  It can also be used to
remove these aliases.

bin/doauto runs all current tests.  Output is captured in
subdirectories under log/.  The whack portion of the output is
compared with that captured under log.ref/.  We don't yet distribute a
sample log.ref.
