.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ikeping
sends and receives ISAKMP/IKE echo request and echo reply packets. These
packets are intended for diagnostics purposes, in a manner similar to 
.IR ping (8)
does for ICMP echo request/reply packets.
.PP
At the time of this writing, the ISAKMP echo request/reply exchange is still
an internet-draft, and is therefore completely non-standard.
.PP
.I Ikeping
will bind to the local address given by 
.B \-\-ikeaddress
and the port number given by
.B \-\-ikeport
defaulting to the wildcard address and the ISAKMP port 500. An ISAKMP
exchange of type 244 (a private use number) is sent to each of the
address/ports listed on the command line. The exchange number may be
overridden by the  
.B \-\-exchangenum 
option.
.PP
.I Ikeping
then listens for replies, printing them as they are received. Replies
are of exchange type 245 or the specified exchange number plus 1.
.I Ikeping 
will keep listening until it either receives as many echo responses as it sent,
or until the timeout period (10 seconds) has been reached. Receipt of a
packet will reset the timer. The 
.B \-\-wait
option can be used to specify a different timeout period. 
.PP
If the 
.B \-\-listen
option is given, then 
.I ikeping
will not send any packets. Instead, it will listen for them and reply to
each request received.
