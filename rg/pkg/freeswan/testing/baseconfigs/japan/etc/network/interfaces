# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
#
#
# !!!NOTE!!! THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE! DO NOT RELY ON IT!
#
# Consider this the first draft of what I think the proper way to
# configure interfaces is. It makes use of programs like ifconfig(8)
# and dhcpcd(8), and can be called from /etc/init.d/networking,
# /etc/pcmcia/network or the command line. It can configure and
# deconfigure interfaces. In controlled environments it even works.
# It's *very* subject to change, however. Some of the compulsory
# options will become optional. Some of the optional ones might
# become compulsory. Syntax might change. Features might disappear.
# Bugs might disappear. The examples below are reasonably likely
# to remain more or less correct. Maybe.
#                                         -- ajt@debian.org
#
#
# A "#" character in the very first column makes the rest of the line
# be ignored. Blank lines are ignored. Lines may be indented freely.
# A "\" character at the very end of the line indicates the next line
# should be treated as a continuation of the current one.
#
# The "noauto", "up", and "down" options are valid for all interfaces.
# "up" and "down" may be specified multiple times, all other options
# may only be specified once.

# We always want the loopback interface. Whether we want ifup/ifdown to
# know about is another matter, perhaps.
#
 iface lo inet loopback

# An example ethernet card setup: (broadcast and gateway are optional)
#
iface eth0 inet static
     address 192.0.1.2
     network 192.0.1.0
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     broadcast 192.0.1.255
     gateway 192.0.1.254

# A more complicated ethernet setup: (the "up" lines are executed verbatim
# when the interface is brought up, the "down" lines when it's brought down)
#
# iface eth0 inet static
#     address 192.168.1.42
#     network 192.168.1.0
#     netmask 255.255.255.128
#     broadcast 192.168.1.0
#     up route add -net 192.168.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 gw 192.168.1.2
#     up route add default gw 192.168.1.200
#     down route del default gw 192.168.1.200
#     down route del -net 192.168.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.128 gw 192.168.1.2

# An ethernet DHCP client: (using the dhcpcd .deb)
#
# iface eth0 inet dhcp

# A more complicated DHCP client: (hostname and leasetime match the options
# in the dhcpcd manpage)
#
# iface eth0 inet dhcp
#     hostname charisma
#     leasetime 3600

# A PCMCIA ethernet DHCP client:
#
# iface eth0 inet dhcp
#     noauto
#
# (note, this won't work unless you specifically change the file
# /etc/pcmcia/network to look more like:
#
#     if [ -r ./shared ] ; then . ./shared ; else . /etc/pcmcia/shared ; fi
#     get_info $DEVICE
#     case "$ACTION" in
#         'start')
#             /sbin/ifup -s "$SCHEME" $DEVICE
#             ;;
#         'stop')
#             /sbin/ifdown -s "$SCHEME" $DEVICE
#             ;;
#     esac
#     exit 0
#
# This is not at all supported at present. You have been warned.)

# An ethernet bootp client: (bootfile, server and hwaddr options are also
# available. See the bootpc manpage)
#
# iface eth0 inet bootp
