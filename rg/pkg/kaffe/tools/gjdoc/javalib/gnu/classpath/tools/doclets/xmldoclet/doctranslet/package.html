A DocTranslet consists of a number of files, normally XSL sheets,
which define how to postprocess the raw XML information output by
xmldoclet. These files are normally bundled in a single Jar file.

There is only one file in a DocTranslet that is required and whose
format is defined, think of it as an index file. This file must be
named <code>DocTranslet.xsl</code> and it must be a stylesheet that
produces XML code which conforms to the structure defined by
DocTranslet.rng.

The resulting XML code tells xmldoclet what user-supplied XSL sheets
it should apply and what user-supplied classes it should run on the
resulting files, if any. 

See DocTranslet.rng for information on the structure of the XML data.
