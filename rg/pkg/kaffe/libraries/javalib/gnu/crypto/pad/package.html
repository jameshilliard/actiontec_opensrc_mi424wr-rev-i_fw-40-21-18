Provides a basic API for using block cipher padding algorithms.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>A padding scheme is merely a standard method of ensuring that the input
to be encrypted is a multiple of the cipher's block size.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the important classes participating in this
package:</p>

<p><img src="{@docRoot}/../diagrams/pad_class_diag.png"
         width=296 height=199 border=0></p>

<p>The following example pads an input buffer, transforms the padded buffer
with already-initialized <code>IMode</code> instances, then unpads the
output buffer.</p>

<pre>
IPad padding = IPad.getInstance("PKCS7");
padding.init(blockSize);

byte[] pad = padding.pad(input, 0, input.length);
byte[] pt = new byte[input.length + pad.length];
byte[] ct = new byte[pt.length];
byte[] cpt = new byte[pt.length];
System.arraycopy(input, 0, pt, 0, input.length);
System.arraycopy(pad, 0, pt, input.length, pad.length);

for (int i = 0; i + blockSize < pt.length; i += blockSize)
  {
    enc.update(pt, i, ct, i);
  }

for (int i = 0; i + blockSize < ct.length; i += blockSize)
  {
    dec.update(ct, i, cpt, i);
  }

int unpad = padding.unpad(cpt, 0, cpt.length);
byte[] output = new byte[cpt.length - unpad];
System.arraycopy(cpt, 0, output, 0, output.length);
