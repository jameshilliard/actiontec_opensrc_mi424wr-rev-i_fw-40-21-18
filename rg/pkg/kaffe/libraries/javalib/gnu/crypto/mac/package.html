Provides a basic API for using Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>A Message Authentication Code, or MAC, is akin to a <i>keyed hash
function</i>, in that it produces a fixed-length identifier for
variable-length data along with a key. The purpose of a MAC is to
guarantee the integrity and authenticity of data, as it is computationally
infeasible to fake a MAC without knowledge of the key.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the important classes participating in this
package:</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to use the HMAC algorithm, with a SHA-1
<i>hash</i>.</p>

<pre>
IMac mac = MacFactory.getInstance("HMAC-SHA-160");

HashMap attributes = new HashMap();
attributes.put(IMac.MAC_KEY_MATERIAL, key_bytes);
attributes.put(IMac.TRUNCATED_SIZE, new Integer(12));
mac.init(attributes);

mac.update(input, 0, input.length);

byte[] result = mac.digest();
