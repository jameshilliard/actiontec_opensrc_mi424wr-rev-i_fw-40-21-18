Provides a basic API for using cryptographically strong pseudo random number
generation algorithms.


<h2>Package overview</h2>

<p>Random number generators, used in cryptography, are based on algorithms
which output sequences of statically independent and unbiased bits.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the important classes participating in this
package:</p>

<p>The following example shows how to instantiate, use, and clone a PRNG
based on the <i>RC4</i> stream cipher algorithm.</p>

<pre>
byte[] b1 = new byte[16];
byte[] b2 = new byte[16];
HashMap attrib = new HashMap();
attrib.put(ARCFour.ARCFOUR_KEY_MATERIAL, new byte[0]);

IRandom r1 = PRNGFactory.getInstance(Registry.ARCFOUR_PRNG);
r1.init(attrib);
r1.nextBytes(b1, 0, b1.length);

IRandom r2 = (IRandom) r1.clone();

r1.nextBytes(b1, 0, b1.length);
r2.nextBytes(b2, 0, b1.length);
</pre>
