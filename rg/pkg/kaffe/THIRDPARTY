    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited

    modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the 
    text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started 
    with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from 
    the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has 
    such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception to 
    the GPL from your modified version.

  ANTLR 1989-2004 Developed by Terence Parr
  Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com

  We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
  public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
  they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
  code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
  ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

  We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
  we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
  ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
  incorporate any source code into one of your programs
  (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
  you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
  research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
  developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
  you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
  headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
  guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
  system and expect to make other tools available as they are
  completed.
