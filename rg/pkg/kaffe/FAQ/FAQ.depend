Kaffe's build environment no longer has a depend target.  The automake
snapshot recommended for Kaffe (see FAQ.automake) takes care of
generating dependencies as a side-effect of compilation, if possible,
unless you `configure --disable-dependency-tracking', or in addition
to compilation, if some dependency generator is available and you
`configure --enable-dependency-tracking'.
