PECULIARITIES OF THIS INSTALLATION
==================================

This version of kaffe was built on my Amiga 4000, which contains
a Cyberstorm II with 68060 at 50 MHz. The 68060, like the 68040,
has a built-in FPU. This kaffe build depends on the presence of 
such an FPU. I have not tested, and can not guarantee, that it 
will work on an Amiga 1200, with a 68030.

The file config/m68k/common.h contains assembler code for the 
function sysdepCallMethod() and the macro COMPARE_AND_EXCHANGE.
These functions depend on at least a 68020 CPU for the op-codes
"casl".

The function config/m68k/amigaos/md.c:md_init() contains code to
initialise the FPU to "round to nearest". This code may not work
on a CPU/FPU combination less than a 68040 or 68060.

The "configure" script contains a test for the integer divide
unit. The code tests whether the most negative number can be
divided by -1 and the result. If this "long modulo" is "broken",
the configure script ensures that kaffe is built with a work-
around for the problem. This code works on a 68060, but has not
been tested on other CPUs.
