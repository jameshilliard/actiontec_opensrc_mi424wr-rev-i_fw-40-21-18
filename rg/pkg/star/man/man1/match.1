.SH NAME
match \- searches for patterns in files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
match
[
.I \-option
] 
.I pattern
[
.I file \.\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
. \" .SH BESCHREIBUNG
.I Match
searches the named files or standard input (if no filenames are given)
for the occurrences of the given pattern on each line.
The program accepts literal characters or special pattern matching characters.
All lines that match the pattern are output on standard output.
You can only specify one pattern string for each match, however, you can
construct an arbitrarily complex string.
When you do not specify a file, match can be used as a filter to display
desired lines.
Standard in is used if no files are specified.
.SH OPTIONS
. \" .SH OPTIONEN

.SH "REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"
The following is a table of all the pattern matching characters:
.TP
.I c
An ordinary character
.I (not
one of the special characters discussed below) is a one character regular
expression that matches that character.
.TP
.BI \e\| c
A backslash (\|\e\|) followed by any special character is a one character 
regular expression that matches the special character itself. The special 
characters are:
.RS
.TP
! # % * { } [ ] \|\e\| ? ^ $
.RE
.TP
.B !
Logical
.B OR
as in match
.I "this!that!the_other."
You may have to use `{}' for precedence
grouping.
.TP
.B #
A hash mark followed by any regular expression matches any number
(including zero) occurrences of the regular expression.
.TP
.B ?
Matches exactly any one character.
.B W?
matches
.I "Wa, Wb, Wc, W1, W2, W3 .\|.\|."
.TP
.B *
Matches any number of any character.
.TP
.B %
Matches exactly nothing. It can be used in groups of ored patterns to specify
that an empty alternative is possible.
.TP
.B {}
Curly brackets may be used to enclose patterns to specify a precedence
grouping, and may be nested.
.B {%!{test}}version
matches the strings
.I "testversion"
and
.I version.
.TP
.BI [ string ]
A non empty string of characters enclosed in square brackets
is a one character regular expression that matches
.I any one
character in that string.
If however the first character of the string is a circumflex (\|^\|),
the one character expression matches any character which is
.I not
in the string. The ^ has this special meaning
.I only
if it occurs first in the string. The minus (\|\-\|) may be used to
indicate a range of consecutive ASCII characters; for example, [0-9] is
equivalent to
.I any one of the digits.
The \- loses it's special meaning if it occurs
first (after an initial ^, if any) or last in the string.
The right square bracket (]) and the backslash (\|\e\|)
must be quoted with a backslash if you want to use it within the
.I string.
.TP
.B ^
Matches the beginning of a line.
.TP
.B $
Matches the end of a line. (\|^*$ matches any entire line)

Even if a match occurs more than once per line, the line is output only once.
.PP
Quote special pattern matching characters to prevent them from
being expanded by the Command Interpreter.
.SH BUGS
The length of the pattern is currently limited to 100 characters.
.PP
This limit is reduced by 38 if the
.B \-w
option is used.
