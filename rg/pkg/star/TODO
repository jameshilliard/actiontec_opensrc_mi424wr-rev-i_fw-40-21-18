NOTE: Before blaming star for something found in this list, look at your favorite
	tar implementation for the presence of similar bugs/missing features.


-	Better telldir() error handling (break; in directory read loop???)

-	Need a way to handle backups that include /export/home & /home: Missing links
	message because loopback filesystem gives more hardlinks than really present.

-	Linkcount below zero with the command: star -c /usr/bin /usr/bin

-	Add Option to both (verbose print & errors) appear on stderr.

-	malloc path buffers and 'chdir' to be able to deal with pathnames > 1024 bytes.

-	add an option to reduce primary file name length to 99 chars
	for all formats to enhance the portability of the archives.

-	union member .dbuf is still star_header!!!

-	If -p flag is ommited, files are handled different from old tar. 
	Star always does does a chmod on non directories.
	Tar uses creat(file, st_mode & 0x07777)

-	AIX uses tape.h ??? for mt ioctl's

-	Size for hard links cannot be checked!!!
