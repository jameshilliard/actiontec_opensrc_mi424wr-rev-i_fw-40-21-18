#
# Each USER= entry adds the listed user to the users who may run rmt
#
# A typical passwd entry looks like this:
# rtape:x:1999:1000:Remote TAPE:/export/home/tape:/opt/schily/sbin/rmt
#
# Add entries for all valid remote users to /export/home/tape/.rhosts
#
USER=rtape
USER=joerg
#USER=*

#
# Each ACCESS= entry adds a target or group of targets to the list of visible
# targets for all users that do remote tape/file access from a specific host.
#
#	Username is the name of the user that runs rmt. If you create
#	different users, you may assign different permissions to different
#	users from the same host.
#
#	Hostname must be in the same notation as needed for .rhosts (e.g. in
#	the way you will be listed by 'who' if you log in from this host).
#
