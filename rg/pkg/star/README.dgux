If you are running DG/UX, you may want to do some experiments
with unbuffered filereads.
This will in general only work in single user mode because
files that are already open may not be opened unbuffered,
but may give up to 50% more throughput.

The diffs are in the file:

star/create.dgux.patch

and should be applied to the file star/create.c
