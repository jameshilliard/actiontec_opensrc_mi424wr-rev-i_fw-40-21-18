If uname -a does print someting like:

Darwin HOST 1.4 Darwin Kernel Version 1.4: Sun Sep  9 15:39:59 PDT 2001; root:xnu/xnu-201.obj~1/RELEASE_PPC  Power Macintosh powerpc

or a version > 1.4 then you should rather read  README.macosX

Unfortunately, Apple does not deliver a consistent Mac OS-X system
The longer they work on it, the more bugs they introduce...

In addition, there is no visible 'clean' road of development.
Release names (from 'uname') are confusing and don't help to find out what
release they refer to.

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
	The next hint is for Mac OS X versions up to January 2000 only:

The file <bsd/dev/scsireg.h> tries to include <kern/queue.h> which cannot
be found.

To be able to compile, I suggest to create a symlink:

System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/Versions/B/Headers/kern -> kernserv

To do this, chdir to:

System/Library/Frameworks/System.framework/Versions/B/Headers/

and call 

ln -s kernserv kern

as root.

	This hint is for Mac OS X version starting ~ April 2000:

Apple did remove the generic SCSI transport driver for unknown reasons!
Cdrtools compile, but as there is no SCSI transport, you may only write
CD's connected to other systems using the REMOTE SCSI protocol.
/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
	This hint is for Mac OS X versions starting around March 2001:

If your compile log looks like this:

         ==> MAKING "all" ON SUBCOMPONENT ".../libschily.mk"
         ==> COMPILING "OBJ/powerpc-darwin-cc/cmpbytes.o"
cmpbytes.c: In function `cmpbytes':
cmpbytes.c:49: invalid operands to binary |
make[1]: *** [OBJ/powerpc-darwin-cc/cmpbytes.o] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2

You are hit by the Apple developers. Some time ago they started to introduce
a file <inttypes.h> which uses types defines in <sys/types.h>
While the buggy types are ignored in <sys/types.h> they are used if found
in <inttypes.h>.

As a workaround, you may edit  

	incs/power-macintosh-darwin-cc/xconfig.h

after it has been created by autoconf and make the lint containing
HAME_INTTYPES_H this way:

/* #undef HAVE_INTTYPES_H */    /* to use UNIX-98 inttypes.h */ 

This will tell the autoconf using code to ignore the system supplied
<inttypes.h> and use the internal version.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to tell the Apple support that MacOSX sucks until they
fix such fundamental bugs in the system include files!

In case you are interested in the full details: the reason why cdrecord
does not compile is that MacOS X defines a type

typedef	int *		intptr_t;
typedef	unsigned int *	uintptr_t;

instead of the correct:

typedef	long		intptr_t;
typedef	unsigned long	intptr_t;

... a result of either Apple developers being unwilling to read or unable to 
understand simple standards written in English :-(
