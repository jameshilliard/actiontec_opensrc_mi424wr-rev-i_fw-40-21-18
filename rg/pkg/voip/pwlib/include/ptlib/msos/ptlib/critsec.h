 * Revision 1.2  2005/11/04 06:34:20  csoutheren
 * Added new class PSync as abstract base class for all mutex/sempahore classes
 * Changed PCriticalSection to use Wait/Signal rather than Enter/Leave

 * This allows use of very efficient mutex primitives in 99% of cases where timed waits
 * are not needed
