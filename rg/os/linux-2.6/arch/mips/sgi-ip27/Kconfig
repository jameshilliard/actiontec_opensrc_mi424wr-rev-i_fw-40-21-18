#config SGI_SN0_XXL
#	bool "IP27 XXL"
#	depends on SGI_IP27
#	  This options adds support for userspace processes upto 16TB size.
#	  Normally the limit is just .5TB.

config SGI_SN0_N_MODE
	bool "IP27 N-Mode"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  The nodes of Origin 200, Origin 2000 and Onyx 2 systems can be
	  configured in either N-Modes which allows for more nodes or M-Mode
	  which allows for more memory.  Your system is most probably
	  running in M-Mode, so you should say N here.

config ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE
	bool
	default y if SGI_IP27
	help
	  Say Y to upport efficient handling of discontiguous physical memory,
	  for architectures which are either NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)
	  or have huge holes in the physical address space for other reasons.
	  See <file:Documentation/vm/numa> for more.

config NUMA
	bool "NUMA Support"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  Say Y to compile the kernel to support NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory
	  Access).  This option is for configuring high-end multiprocessor
	  server machines.  If in doubt, say N.

config MAPPED_KERNEL
	bool "Mapped kernel support"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  Change the way a Linux kernel is loaded into memory on a MIPS64
	  machine.  This is required in order to support text replication and
	  NUMA.  If you need to understand it, read the source code.

config REPLICATE_KTEXT
	bool "Kernel text replication support"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel text across multiple
	  nodes in a NUMA cluster.  This trades memory for speed.

config REPLICATE_EXHANDLERS
	bool "Exception handler replication support"
	depends on SGI_IP27
	help
	  Say Y here to enable replicating the kernel exception handlers
	  across multiple nodes in a NUMA cluster. This trades memory for
	  speed.
