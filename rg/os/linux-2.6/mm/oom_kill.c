 *	Thanks go out to Claus Fischer for some serious inspiration and
 *	for goading me into coding this file...
 *
 *  The routines in this file are used to kill a process when
 *  we're seriously out of memory. This gets called from __alloc_pages()
 *  in mm/page_alloc.c when we really run out of memory.
 *
 *  Since we won't call these routines often (on a well-configured
 *  machine) this file will double as a 'coding guide' and a signpost
 *  for newbie kernel hackers. It features several pointers to major
 *  kernel subsystems and hints as to where to find out what things do.

/**
 * oom_badness - calculate a numeric value for how bad this task has been
 * @p: task struct of which task we should calculate
 * @uptime: current uptime in seconds
 *
 * The formula used is relatively simple and documented inline in the
 * function. The main rationale is that we want to select a good task
 * to kill when we run out of memory.
 *
 * Good in this context means that:
 * 1) we lose the minimum amount of work done
 * 2) we recover a large amount of memory
 * 3) we don't kill anything innocent of eating tons of memory
 * 4) we want to kill the minimum amount of processes (one)
 * 5) we try to kill the process the user expects us to kill, this
 *    algorithm has been meticulously tuned to meet the principle
 *    of least surprise ... (be careful when you change it)
