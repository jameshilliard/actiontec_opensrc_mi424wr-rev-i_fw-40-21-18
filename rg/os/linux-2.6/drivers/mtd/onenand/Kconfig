	  This enables support for accessing all type of OneNAND flash
	  devices. For further information see

config MTD_ONENAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify OneNAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  OneNAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_ONENAND_GENERIC
	tristate "OneNAND Flash device via platform device driver"
	depends on MTD_ONENAND && ARM
	help
	  Support for OneNAND flash via platform device driver.

config MTD_ONENAND_SYNC_READ
	bool "OneNAND Sync. Burst Read Support"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP
