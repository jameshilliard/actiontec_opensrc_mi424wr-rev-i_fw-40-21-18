Some known problems:

-- Compiling the kernel with -j for parallel makes is not completely safe
due to missing dependencies with offset.h. Usually it is safe when it 
already exists, but not always.

Current hack is to rerun make depend manually when you change anything
that would touch offset.h (see arch/x86-64/tools/offset.c on what that is).
Do not use -j with depend.
