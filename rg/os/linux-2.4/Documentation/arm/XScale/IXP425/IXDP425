Board Overview
--------------

The IXDP425 is an evaluation platform for Intel's IXP425 network processor.

The IXP425 contains on chip dual-UARTs, PCI host bridge, USB endpoint,
two 10/100 NPEs (Network Programmable Engines) and 1 WAN NPE, and 16 GPIOs.

The IXDP425 contains four PCI slots, a set of 7 segment LEDs, 16MB 
of flash, and a serial PROM connected to two GPIO lines.

Port Status
-----------

Supported:

- MTD/JFFS2 access of on board flash
- NFS root
- RAMDISK root
- Serial console on ttyS0
- PCI E100 card

Not Supported:

- NPEs
- USB endpoint
- I2C access

Building the Kernel
-------------------

Note: You will need a toolchain that has proper support for big endian builds.

make ixdp425_config
make oldconfig
make dep 
make zImage

This will build an image setup for BOOTP/NFS root support.  To change this,
just change the "root=" option on the commandline.

Preparing the Hardware
----------------------

Make sure you do an 'fis init' command once you boot up to intialize
RedBoot's flash filesystem.

Connect the serial port on your host to the serial port labeled UART0
on the board.

Configure minicom for 115200N81

Loading the Kernel
------------------

   RedBoot> load -r -v -b 0x11608000 zImage
   RedBoot> go 0x11608000


Root Devices
------------

A kernel is not useful without a root filesystem, and you have several
choices with this board:  NFS root, RAMDISK, or JFFS/JFFS2.  For development 
purposes, it is suggested that you use NFS root for easy access to various 
tools.  Once you're ready to deploy, probably want to utilize JFFS/JFFS2 on 
the flash device.  


MTD on the IXDP425
------------------

Please read the file Documentation/arm/XScale/IOP3xx/IQ80310 for information
on mapping RedBoot FIS partitions to MTD partitions.


Using >64MB RAM
---------------

By default, the kernel is configure to only use 64MB of memory.  There
is a very good reason for this.  The inbound PCI window on the IXP425
is only 64MB in size, so if you are using more memory than this, all
PCI DMA buffers above 64MB need to be bounced down to the 64MB 
GFP_DMA area.  This is very expensive and will lead to performance
degradation. To use more then 64MB of memory, you need to turn on
CONFIG_IXP425_LARGE_SDRAM and then updated the "mem=" portion
of the command line appropriately.
