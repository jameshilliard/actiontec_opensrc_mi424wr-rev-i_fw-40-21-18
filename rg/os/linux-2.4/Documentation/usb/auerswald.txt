		Auerswald USB kernel driver
		===========================

What is it? What can I do with it?
==================================
The auerswald USB kernel driver connects your linux 2.4.x
system to the auerswald usb-enabled devices.

There are two types of auerswald usb devices:
a) small PBX systems (ISDN)
b) COMfort system telephones (ISDN)

The driver installation creates the devices
/dev/usb/auer0..15. These devices carry a vendor-
specific protocol. You may run all auerswald java
software on it. The java software needs a native
library "libAuerUsbJNINative.so" installed on
your system. This library is available from
auerswald and shipped as part of the java software.

You may create the devices with:
	mknod -m 666 /dev/usb/auer0 c 180 112
	...
	mknod -m 666 /dev/usb/auer15 c 180 127

ISDN support
============
If you enable CONFIG_USB_AUERISDN, you will get full
ISDN modem support via the HISAX ISDN4LINUX driver.

Of course, as for every USB-based ISDN adaptor, you
will have to modify your hotplug scripts to load
the isdn subsystem and configure the network interfaces.
Same procedure as for the ST5481 driver.


The maintainer of this driver is wolfgang@iksw-muees.de
