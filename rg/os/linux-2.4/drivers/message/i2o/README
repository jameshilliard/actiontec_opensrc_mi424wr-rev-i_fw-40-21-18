Hardware Compatibility

This is an informal test summary. It is not definitive as a reference work
or guaranteed of any accuracy.

Previous Stable Release (2.4.18ac3)
	AMI MegaRAID[0]		FAIL

	Intel SCU RAID		FAIL[2]	???	N/A	???	FAIL[2]

[0] In I2O mode. For normal mode use the megaraid driver
[1] Initialisation oddities and scsi failure. Use dpt_i2o module instead.
[2] Card hangs under certain load patterns.
[3] The driver works correctly. Certain values are misreported by this
card but the results are only cosmetic. Firmware updates are required for some
very early cards. Set the card into I2O not 'Linux' mode.
[4] HTML configuration mode not available.

Requirements
------------

I2O 1.5 compliant hardware
PCI bus interrupt driven I2O devices
Devices in classes Block, Lan or SCSI.
32bit I2O messages supported

Limitations
-----------
64bit message formats are not supported (64bit I2O is basically a whole 
		different driver variant)
I2O Tape class is not supported (no known devices using this..)
Currently only 32bit x86 platforms are supported.

--------
	This work was made possible by 

Red Hat
	Funding for the Building #3 part of the project

Symbios Logic (Now LSI)
	Host adapters, hints, known to work platforms when I hit
	compatibility problems

BoxHill Corporation
	Loan of initial FibreChannel disk array used for development work.

European Comission
	Funding the work done by the University of Helsinki

Promise
	Providing a Supertrak 100 board and support info

DPT (now Adaptec)
	Providing a DPT smartraid I2O card (use dpt_i2o for this
	board however)


General:
o	Finish 64bit and big endian cleanup
o	Switch to new PCI mapping layer throughout
o	Hotswap of controllers
o	PCI IOP's without interrupts are not supported yet
o	Push FAIL handling into the core

Block:
o	Multiple major numbers (problem goes away in 2.5)
o	Power management

SCSI:

Lan:	
o	Performance tuning
o	Test Fibre Channel code

Tape:
o	Anyone seen anything implementing this ?
