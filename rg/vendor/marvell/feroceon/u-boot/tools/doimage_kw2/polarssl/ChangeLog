XySSL ChangeLog

= Version 0.9 released on 2008-03-16

    * Added support for ciphersuite: SSL_RSA_AES_128_SHA
    * Enabled support for large files by default in aescrypt2.c
    * Preliminary openssl wrapper contributed by David Barrett
    * Fixed a bug in ssl_write() that caused the same payload to
      be sent twice in non-blocking mode when send returns EAGAIN
    * Fixed ssl_parse_client_hello(): session id and challenge must
      not be swapped in the SSLv2 ClientHello (found by Greg Robson)
    * Added user-defined callback debug function (Krystian Kolodziej)
    * Before freeing a certificate, properly zero out all cert. data
    * Fixed the "mode" parameter so that encryption/decryption are
      not swapped on PadLock; also fixed compilation on older versions
      of gcc (bug reported by David Barrett)
    * Correctly handle the case in padlock_xcryptcbc() when input or
      ouput data is non-aligned by falling back to the software
      implementation, as VIA Nehemiah cannot handle non-aligned buffers
    * Fixed a memory leak in x509parse_crt() which was reported by Greg
      Robson-Garth; some x509write.c fixes by Pascal Vizeli, thanks to
      Matthew Page who reported several bugs
    * Fixed x509_get_ext() to accept some rare certificates which have
      an INTEGER instead of a BOOLEAN for BasicConstraints::cA.
    * Added support on the client side for the TLS "hostname" extension
      (patch contributed by David Patino)
    * Make x509parse_verify() return BADCERT_CN_MISMATCH when an empty
      string is passed as the CN (bug reported by spoofy)
    * Added an option to enable/disable the BN assembly code
    * Updated rsa_check_privkey() to verify that (D*E) = 1 % (P-1)*(Q-1)
    * Disabled obsolete hash functions by default (MD2, MD4); updated
      selftest and benchmark to not test ciphers that have been disabled
    * Updated x509parse_cert_info() to correctly display byte 0 of the
      serial number, setup correct server port in the ssl client example
    * Fixed a critical denial-of-service with X.509 cert. verification:
      peer may cause xyssl to loop indefinitely by sending a certificate
      for which the RSA signature check fails (bug reported by Benoit)
    * Added test vectors for: AES-CBC, AES-CFB, DES-CBC and 3DES-CBC,
      HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512
    * Fixed HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512 (thanks to Josh Sinykin)
    * Modified ssl_parse_client_key_exchange() to protect against
      Daniel Bleichenbacher attack on PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, as well
      as the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of Bleichenbacher's attack
    * Updated rsa_gen_key() so that ctx->N is always nbits in size
    * Fixed assembly PPC compilation errors on Mac OS X, thanks to
      David Barrett and Dusan Semen

= Version 0.8 released on 2007-10-20

    * Modified the HMAC functions to handle keys larger
      than 64 bytes, thanks to Stephane Desneux and gary ng
    * Fixed ssl_read_record() to properly update the handshake
      message digests, which fixes IE6/IE7 client authentication
    * Cleaned up the XYSSL* #defines, suggested by Azriel Fasten
    * Fixed net_recv(), thanks to Lorenz Schori and Egon Kocjan
    * Added user-defined callbacks for handling I/O and sessions
    * Added lots of debugging output in the SSL/TLS functions
    * Added preliminary X.509 cert. writing by Pascal Vizeli
    * Added preliminary support for the VIA PadLock routines
    * Added AES-CFB mode of operation, contributed by chmike
    * Added an SSL/TLS stress testing program (ssl_test.c)
    * Updated the RSA PKCS#1 code to allow choosing between
      RSA_PUBLIC and RSA_PRIVATE, as suggested by David Barrett
    * Updated ssl_read() to skip 0-length records from OpenSSL
    * Fixed the make install target to comply with *BSD make
    * Fixed a bug in mpi_read_binary() on 64-bit platforms
    * mpi_is_prime() speedups, thanks to Kevin McLaughlin
    * Fixed a long standing memory leak in mpi_is_prime()
    * Replaced realloc with malloc in mpi_grow(), and set
      the sign of zero as positive in mpi_init() (reported
      by Jonathan M. McCune)

= Version 0.7 released on 2007-07-07

    * Added support for the MicroBlaze soft-core processor
    * Fixed a bug in ssl_tls.c which sometimes prevented SSL
      connections from being established with non-blocking I/O
    * Fixed a couple bugs in the VS6 and UNIX Makefiles
    * Fixed the "PIC register ebx clobbered in asm" bug
    * Added HMAC starts/update/finish support functions
    * Added the SHA-224, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hash functions
    * Fixed the net_set_*block routines, thanks to Andreas
    * Added a few demonstration programs: md5sum, sha1sum,
      dh_client, dh_server, rsa_genkey, rsa_sign, rsa_verify
    * Added new bignum import and export helper functions
    * Rewrote README.txt in program/ssl/ca to better explain
      how to create a test PKI
