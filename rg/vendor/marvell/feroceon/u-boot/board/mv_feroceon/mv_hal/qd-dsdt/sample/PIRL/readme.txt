		PIRL (Port based Ingress Rate Limit) Setup 
==================================================================

88E6065 device family, 88E6097 device family, and recent Marvell SOHO 
Switch Devices support 'Best-in-Class' per port TCP/IP ingress rate limiting 
(based on some kind of a bucket scheme to keep track of the bandwidth) along 
with independent Storm prevention. 

This sample shows how to use PIRL resources.
