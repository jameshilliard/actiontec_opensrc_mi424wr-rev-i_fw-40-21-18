	  This option enables a polled compact flash driver for use with
	  compact flash cards attached to the Octeon boot bus. This interface
	  is quite slow. It has a maximum rate of about 1.5 MB/s.

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_HW_FIX_UNALIGNED

	depends on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS
	default "y"
	help
	  Configure the Octeon hardware to automatically fix unaligned loads
	  and stores. Normally unaligned accesses are fixed using a kernel
	  exception handler. This option enables the hardware automatic fixups,
	  which requires only an extra 3 cycles. Disable this option if you
	  are running code that relies on address exceptions on unaligned
	  accesses.

          CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache as a
	  local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the cache is.
	  This selects the size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The
	  legally range is from zero to 54 cache blocks (i.e. CVMSEG LM is
	  between zero and 6192 bytes).

config CAVIUM_OCTEON_USER_IO
	bool "Allow User space to access hardware IO directly"

	help
	  Allows user applications to directly access the Octeon hardware
	  IO addresses (0x1000000000000 - 0x1ffffffffffff). This allows high
	  performance networking applications to run in user space with minimal
	  performance penalties. This also means a user application can bring
	  down the entire system. Only use this option on embedded devices
	  where all user applications are strictly controlled.

	  Allows user applications to use XKPHYS addresses directly to memory.
	  This allows user space direct access to shared memory not in use by
	  Linux. This memory is suitable for use with the Octeon hardware.
	  Cavium simple executive applications also share this memory. Since
	  this bypass all of the Linux memory protection, only use this option
	  on embedded devices where all user applications are strictly
	  controlled.

	  Reserve a shared memory region for user processes to use for hardware

	  Number of packet buffers (and work queue entries) to allocate from
	  reserved user memory. These buffers are in the userspace address
	  range and may be used for zero copy access to ethernet packets from
	  userspace. Normal kernel ethernet performance will suffer since
	  received ethernet packets will need to be copied from these buffers
	  into the normal kernel skbuf structures. Only use this option if
	  high performance ethernet is need in userspace, bypassing the kernel.
	  This will reduce the userspace shared region by
